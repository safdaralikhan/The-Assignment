                <h3>Report on Transition to young parenthood
                </h3>
                <p>Introduction of Transition to young parenthood
                </p>
                <p>Becoming parent for the first time is an important transitional phase in the life of individuals
                    especially during adolescence. Age is a major aspect for parenthood but there are several other factors
                    that play important role in increasing the chances of success as young parents. The present report
                    features the concepts of adolescence, its origins and emergence as well as its relevance in social
                    construct. In addition to this, it also explores a range of sources that instigate the basis of moral
                    panics in the respect of young people and their implications in shaping the discourses among young
                    people. Besides this, the present report also features different theoretical perspectives that explain
                    young people transition to adulthood.
                </p>
                <p>Concepts of Adolescence explained through Stanley Hall’s work
                </p>
                <p>The concepts of Adolescence can be explained by demonstrating the seminal work of Stanley Hall. In the
                    year 1904, Stanley Hall explained through his monumental work called “Adolescence” that is an alteration
                    in human development occurred due to transformation of society in decade’s post-civil war. It was
                    observed that practice of children laboring in the fields and factories along with parents gradually
                    disappeared. This happened due to rise in industrial productivity which kept teenagers labor force out
                    of factories due to installation of machinery to finish work. This new industrial society encouraged
                    young individuals to learn and gain education. Hall considered the stage of adolescence as an alteration
                    in experience among young adults. The author’s work included the characteristics of adolescence and
                    social effects. Hall termed the phase of adolescence as a period of “storm and stress”. He explained
                    that during the transition from childhood to adulthood, teenagers encountered with inevitable turmoil.
                    Stanley Hall has broadly categorized stress and storm into three categories which are as follows:
                    Conflicts with parents During adolescence, young adults tend to act rebellious against parental control
                    as they become independent. This causes conflicts between adolescents and parents. Risky behavior The
                    adolescents often exhibit risky behavior. This is due to emotional immaturity coupled with neurological
                    requirement for stimulation. Mood swings Uncontrollable disruption in mood usually happens during
                    adolescence due to hormonal alterations and psychological stress. Origin and emergence of adolescence as
                    a social construct According Stanley Hall, biological changes of puberty contribute to the period of
                    stress and storm among adolescents. It is found that human body gets some time to adopt these biological
                    changes. Hormonal changes are responsible for causing majority of mood disruption among adolescents.
                    Many young people may feel awkward in response to their physical growth of body. According to Hall, the
                    rate of physical growth and development of girls and boys differ from each other. During this time,
                    neurological connections rapidly grow due to increased growth of dendrites which consequently encourage
                    adolescents to seek stimulation. Other than biological aspects, Hall also featured psychological
                    characteristics that are very peculiar to adolescence. Adolescents behave in a rebellious manner against
                    their parents or other authority figures as they seek more independence with age. It is also found that
                    there is an increase in attention seeking behavior among adolescents during this period. Besides this,
                    risk taking behavior is also common among young people during adolescence. Individuals are more likely
                    to experience feelings of self-consciousness, embarrassment and nervousness more as compared to other
                    phases of life. In addition to this, they also sometimes experience loneliness and depression. Relevance
                    of Adolescence within society Adolescence as a concept is very relevant in terms of social construct.
                    Human society provides a common developmental path during the first two decades of individual’s life.
                    Schooling is an integral part of childhood and adolescence. There are certain laws that guide adults to
                    deal with minors in a specific way. Adolescence is a critical link between childhood and adulthood. The
                    transition carry risks as well as opportunities that greatly impact the future health of young adults.
                    The health of young people has become an important factor of social and economic development. With the
                    increasing adolescence population, there is an increase in funding of research, policies and programs.
                    This is done with an aim to improve the health of young boys and girls so that they can grow into
                    healthy and productive adults and thus they can make capable of giving birth to healthy progeny. Range
                    of sources to determine the extent to which moral panics shape Moral panic can be defined as a feeling
                    of fear that spreads across the large number of individuals that there is some evil which threatens the
                    well-being of society. In other words, it is described as a process of arousing social fear among public
                    over an issue usually done by mass media. Media plays a crucial role in the dissemination of moral panic
                    through reporting of facts which are sufficient to generate panic and concern among mass public. Moral
                    panic takes place when media converts an ordinary event and features it as an extraordinary before
                    society. Periods of rapid social change and agitation lead to occurrence of moral panics. The concept of
                    Moral Panic was developed by Criminologist Stanley Cohen in early 1960 when he explained the reactions
                    of public due to disturbances caused by group of young people called Mods and Rockers at seaside resorts
                    in UK. Cohen’s work explained that these public reactions affected the formation and enforcement of
                    social policies, laws and perceptions in response to threats posed by the group of young people. Since
                    then, the concept of moral panic has been employed to address a broad range of social problems. These
                    problems include violence at school, child abuse, illegal immigration, Satanism and terrorism. History
                    reveals that moral panic was focused on young people and youth crime way back the invention of the term
                    teenager. Since then, sociologists are trying to protect the innocence of adolescents as well as working
                    towards overcoming threats related to youth crime. It has been observed that both media publicity and
                    social reaction to the moral panic may lead to increase in the youth crime rates in future. In other
                    words, it can be said that reaction of society may amplify such behavior among adolescents by provoking
                    them to behave in an undesired manner. Usually adolescents are considered as the targets of moral panics
                    and their behavior is observed as a barometer to examine the health or illness of society. The stories
                    of crime are exaggerated by media related to youth crime such as physical or sexual abuse of young
                    people, out of control teenage groups, use of drugs, street violence, theft, bullying at school and
                    universities raise concerns for more social control over adolescents. Psychologists believe that there
                    is a direct link between violence shown in films, television and computer games as well as violence
                    occurring in real life. It is observed that violence portrayed by media negatively impacts young adults
                    behavior. Sociologists have constantly argued that there is a direct influence of media content over
                    adolescents to a great extent and causes particular social responses in terms of behavior. Feminist
                    sociologists have suggested that there is a strong link between sexual crimes and pornography. In
                    addition to this, there is a direct relationship between the representation of size zero models in
                    fashion magazines and development of eating disorders such as Bulimia and Anorexia among young adults
                    especially girls. Besides this, many sociologists also state that media coverage on political issues
                    greatly impacts the voting behavior among youth. Therefore, there was a need to increase the control
                    over media in UK to censor the content of their programs being aired.</p>
                <p>How youth transitions are conceptualized and explained
                </p>
                <p>Youth transition is referred to transformation of individuals from the phases of childhood into
                    adulthood. Many authors have featured youth transitions in their literature. These are reviewed and
                    critically appraised in the following passages: Cole (2004) has categorized three kinds of youth
                    transitions and his work was highly regarded in UK during the mid of 1970’s.The first type of transition
                    is known as “School to work transition” which can be explained as adolescents leaving school at minimum
                    age and securing full time paid employment with less difficulties. The second category is referred to
                    “Housing transition” which can be elaborated as young people leaving their parent’s home and residing at
                    place of their own. According to the author, housing transition is possible due to stability and
                    security of career that was undertaken by young people. Stable job enables youth to save their own
                    housing plans. The last type is termed as “Family Transition” which states that young adults form
                    relationship, get engaged, married to spouses and have children to create their own family. However, it
                    has been critically analyzed that traditional transitions have transformed to a great extent in the past
                    three decades. Youth transitions have become more complex and less predictable. Due to this, a new term
                    called “Extended Transitions” came into picture. The term can be explained as the process of
                    transformation from childhood to adulthood that takes longer time. It has been observed that there is
                    increased dependency on parents as 1 out of 3 young adults are opting for higher education at
                    universities. Similarly 4 out of 5 young people stay at parents place after leaving school for further
                    training or education extending the housing transition. However , it is also observed that housing
                    transition has changed among young people as they leave parent’s home at the age of 18 but do not get
                    married and stay alone or with their peers or at hostels in universities. There are various social and
                    economic factors that significantly delayed the housing transition due to unavailability of affordable
                    social housing as well as reduced number of stable jobs which affect the financial freedom of young
                    adults. On the contrary, it is observed that there are evidences of the term “Early Transitions” which
                    states that adolescents have undergone accelerated transitions during late 1990’s. Statistical figures
                    suggest that there was an increase in number of incidents of school exclusions in UK in late 1990s
                    (Murphy, 2014). In addition to this, there is also a noticeable increase that contributes to 20 percent
                    in the number of young carers who are adults taking care of parents and siblings in England. In addition
                    to this, other complexity of youth transition includes challenges related to secure first job. Young
                    people are opting for part time and other insecure patterns of job which make it difficult for youth to
                    have sound future plans for financial savings. Thus, due to unemployment issues youth undergo through
                    problematic family transition. However, research paper done by Kok, J.K., 2015, explains that young
                    people of past generations were more aware of their social roles and responsibilities that were
                    incorporated in them by their parents and elders.The paper suggests that emerging adults have been
                    presented as a concept of developmental stage that is full of ambiguity and uncertainty. It has been
                    researched by the author that late adolescents and emerging childhood are the new concepts of
                    developmental phases due to social alterations in the modern era. Most of the young adults in modern
                    society are expected to attend universities to pursue higher studies in order to explore greater
                    opportunities for healthier and successful living. This, in contrast was not very common in young adults
                    of past generations. Though, there are number of opportunities for young people to explore their
                    studies, career, relationships and other life directions, they are also susceptible to vulnerabilities
                    related to copying with extended transitional changes. The author characterized the emerging adulthood
                    as a specific period of the development with numerous unexpected variables and diversity especially when
                    they start their higher education or when they enter into a romantic relationship.</p>
                <p>Evaluate the contribution of social theory to the debates surrounding young people’s transition to
                    adulthood
                </p>
                <p>Social theory is referred to the use of complex theoretical frameworks that are used to explain and
                    analyze the concepts of social world or societies. Though, it is considered as a branch of Sociology, it
                    has various interdisciplinary aspects. Sociological subjects became an integral part of Social Theory to
                    understand society as well as its development. It has been observed that social theory largely reflected
                    traditional views of families and marriages prevailing in societies during that period. The social
                    theory lays emphasis on the ideas about the ways that societies change and develop. In addition to this,
                    it also features the explanation for social behavior and structure, gender, civilization, modernity as
                    well as ethnicity of a societal framework. The Modern Social Theory states that transition of young
                    people is determined by their environment. The key aspects of this theory is individual identity of
                    young people and their roles in their relationships. In a civilized society, young people are expected
                    to complete their school education, followed by higher university education, get a reputed as well as
                    stable job and then get married followed by raising their own children. Childhood is considered as a
                    dependent stage where children depend on their parents and family members for most of their physical and
                    emotional needs such as food, clothing, housing, education, love affection, safety and security from
                    potential harms. On the contrary, adulthood is an independent phase of young adult’s life where in they
                    are self sufficient to meet their overall needs. During adulthood, young people achieve biological as
                    well as intellectual maturity (Arnett, 2006). They are capable enough to take major decisions of their
                    life such as choosing sound career options, financing housing plans, getting married and planning for
                    family. However, Transition to adulthood is quite challenging for any young adult. Attaining
                    self-sufficiency is pretty daunting for young people as they have to struggle hard for a stable and
                    secured job as well as manage their expenses accordingly. It has been evaluated that many young people
                    live with their parents for a longer time and are dependent on families for financial as well as
                    emotional support. Research has suggested that young people who are exposed to protective determinants
                    are more likely to succeed in their future ventures as compared to young adults who have lack of these
                    factors especially people who are brought up under the foster care. Transition of young people to
                    adulthood can be evaluated on the basis of various social, biological, intellectual and educational
                    outcomes. It has been observed that transition to adulthood is not an overnight process. There is a need
                    to empower youth so that they can take better charge of their future. Beside this, parents need to find
                    ways in which they can prepare their younger children for transitioning into adults for creating better
                    individuals of society.</p>
                <p>Conclusion
                </p>
                <p>In a nutshell, the present report presents key points on Youth Transition. It has been learned that there
                    are various concepts that explain the origin and emergence of adolescence and its relevance in today’s
                    society. The concepts of adolescence are explained with the help of seminal work of Stanley Hall through
                    his popular work “Adolescence”. In addition to this, role of media including film, television and print
                    media is also elaborated to show the impact of moral panic among young adults. It has been learned that
                    moral panics significantly influence and shape discourses among youth and determine their behavioral
                    responses by provoking them. Apart from this, the report is critically analyzed on the literature
                    related to youth transitions. Further, it also draws perspectives of social theory and its contribution
                    regarding the young people’s transition to adulthood.

                <p>International Accounting standards have high level of importance which ensures high level transparency
                    and standardization in the financial statements. Hence, final accounts which are prepared according to
                    IFRS are highly reliable in nature and thereby helps stakeholders in making decisions (Florou, Kosi and
                    Pope, 2017). However, technical knowledge is highly required among the individuals or accounting
                    personnel to deal with the aspects of International Accounting Standards such as IAS 12 and 26 etc. In
                    this, accounting personnel must have ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities. Moreover,
                    assets, revenue received in advance, other liabilities, unrecognized items; consolidated financial
                    statements are the main bases of taxation (Warren, 2016). By taking into consideration all such bases
                    accounting personnel can assess or determine the tax liability. In addition to this, in IAS 12 contains
                    rules regarding the measurement of deferred tax. Along with this, tax rate are also varied from one year
                    to another. In this, accounting personnel is required to update with changing rules and policies.
                    Through this, finance manager and accounting personnel would become able to determine suitable tax
                    liability. In addition to this, IAS 26 serves information about retirement plans which can be
                    distinguished into two types such as defined benefit and contribution plan. Hence, it clearly presents
                    information about the recording, measurement and disclosure of information regarding the retirement
                    benefit plans. Hence, for effective presentation accounting personnel must have knowledge regarding the
                    rules and regulations which are related to it (Bond, Govendir and Wells, 2016). Thus, by considering all
                    such aspects it can be said that technical and conceptual knowledge is highly required for dealing with
                    the standards more effectively and efficiently. Moreover, reporting and measurement aspect of pension
                    plan is highly differing from one standard to another (McPhail, Macdonald and Ferguson, 2016). For
                    instance: UK GAAP has different rules in relation to treatment on pension benefits in against to IAS.
                    Hence, conceptual understanding and knowledge is highly required for dealing with the amount of
                    retirement benefits and deferred tax amount. There are several key issues which are associated with
                    financial reporting enumerated below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reporting needs and requirements are mentioned in the regulations which business entity requires
                        following for ensuring transparency in the final accounts. However, sometimes is not possible for
                        the business organization to comply with all the rules to the large extent.
                    </li>
                    <li>Further, some government authorities have framed and introduced legislation which entail that
                        companies are not obliged to prepare financial statements according to accounting standards.
                        Moreover, sometimes treasurer directives also enforce accounting standard which company has to
                        follow for the preparation of financial statements.
