                <p>In 2015, recoverable amount is higher than carrying figure so there is no journal entry has been made.
                </p>
                <h5>C. Explaining the reasons for impairment
                </h5>
                <p>In 2014, carrying amount is $200000, whereas recoverable amount implies for $110000. Hence, carrying
                    amount is higher than recoverable cost which shows the loss of $90000. Carrying cost – recoverable
                    amount $200000 – $110000 = $90000

                <h4>QUESTION 3
                </h4>
                <h5>Interpreting the technical requirements and importance of international accounting standards
                </h5>
                <p>International Accounting standards have high level of importance which ensures high level transparency
                    and standardization in the financial statements. Hence, final accounts which are prepared according to
                    IFRS are highly reliable in nature and thereby helps stakeholders in making decisions (Florou, Kosi and
                    Pope, 2017). However, technical knowledge is highly required among the individuals or accounting
                    personnel to deal with the aspects of International Accounting Standards such as IAS 12 and 26 etc. In
                    this, accounting personnel must have ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities. Moreover,
                    assets, revenue received in advance, other liabilities, unrecognized items; consolidated financial
                    statements are the main bases of taxation (Warren, 2016). By taking into consideration all such bases
                    accounting personnel can assess or determine the tax liability. In addition to this, in IAS 12 contains
                    rules regarding the measurement of deferred tax. Along with this, tax rate are also varied from one year
                    to another. In this, accounting personnel is required to update with changing rules and policies.
                    Through this, finance manager and accounting personnel would become able to determine suitable tax
                    liability. In addition to this, IAS 26 serves information about retirement plans which can be
                    distinguished into two types such as defined benefit and contribution plan. Hence, it clearly presents
                    information about the recording, measurement and disclosure of information regarding the retirement
                    benefit plans. Hence, for effective presentation accounting personnel must have knowledge regarding the
                    rules and regulations which are related to it (Bond, Govendir and Wells, 2016). Thus, by considering all
                    such aspects it can be said that technical and conceptual knowledge is highly required for dealing with
                    the standards more effectively and efficiently. Moreover, reporting and measurement aspect of pension
                    plan is highly differing from one standard to another (McPhail, Macdonald and Ferguson, 2016). For
                    instance: UK GAAP has different rules in relation to treatment on pension benefits in against to IAS.
                    Hence, conceptual understanding and knowledge is highly required for dealing with the amount of
                    retirement benefits and deferred tax amount. There are several key issues which are associated with
                    financial reporting enumerated below:</p>
