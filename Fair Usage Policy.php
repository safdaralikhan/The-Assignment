We have tried to keep this policy simple, but if at any point you come up with queries, then feel free to contact us using the details mentioned at the end of this page.</p><h5>Why Do We Have a Fair Use Policy?</h5><p>The main purpose of our writing services is to help you conduct further research and utilize the information to write your own documents. However, many students submit the work purchased from us directly to their professor to save themselves from the hard work. But this is not how our services should be used because this is a form of plagiarism.</p><p>We have this Fair Use Policy to make you understand that the work delivered to you is copyrighted and the best way to get benefit from it is by considering it as a guide to take notes and ideas, conduct further research, and then create your own scholarly work</p><h5>How Should You Use the Work That We Provide You?</h5><p>The reference papers that our researchers create give students an example of how a specific topic should be handled so that they can form an entirely different view on that subject matter. It helps them gain a perspective to write their papers, collect relevant data from credible sources, and learn the proper formatting. So, instead of submitting our work as your own, you should use it for the following purposes:</p><li>Go through the entire paper to acquire knowledge of the topic and understand how the question has been answered.</li><li>Take a read through each section and paragraph again to focus on important points and make notes.</li><li>Now try to come up with your own ideas and arguments from the notes that you have prepared.</li><li>Find the sources mentioned in the paper provided by us and review them.</li><li>Use these resources to conduct further research and gather more relevant information.</li><li>Make further notes on what you want to cover in your work from the information that you have collected.</li><li>Make sure that your final document is 100% authentic and completely based on your own ideas and perspective.</li> <br><p>Conducting your research and creating 100% original work will take a lot more efforts than simply submitting our reference paper as your work to gain academic credit. But, by doing so, you will get a thorough understanding of the given topic and prepare well for exams.</p><h5>Why Can’t You Submit Our Work to the University as Your Own?</h5><p>Our researchers and writers work tirelessly to gather the best data and produce excellent papers to help you get acquire knowledge of the topic and compose your own documents with a new perspective. Everything they create is entirely original and written exactly as per your instructions. We never upload our work on the web which means that it will never end up being flagged by plagiarism scanners. It also means that if you submit the model papers as your own work, there is no way that your professor will get to know that you have used our services.</p><p>However, your professor could realize the fact that your style of writing doesn’t match to the paper, or that you have used sources that you don’t have access to or sufficient knowledge to find. He/she may even ask you to explain the work back to them, which would get you into trouble if you have handed the work as it is. Submitting the paper we have created as your own is plagiarism which can lead to serious consequences. Even if you rephrase our work, it will still be counted as unoriginal according to your university guidelines and standards.</p><p>So, we strongly recommend you to abide by this Fair Use Policy and use our academic writing services as intended. Complying with our policy will help you write an excellent paper, improve your grades, and give you a sense of satisfaction that you have done an honest job.</p><h5>So, Why Should You Buy Reference Papers From Us?</h5><p>After learning that passing off our work to your professor as your own can put your academic career into trouble, you may be thinking that why should you buy our reference papers then.
