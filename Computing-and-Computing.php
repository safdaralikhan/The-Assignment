Further, computing includes involvement of the computer either with the help of hardware or software. The only aim of computing is to involve some sort of computer device. Computing generally includes designing, developing and structuring the hardware and software system, processing, structuring and managing different types of information, etc. Computing also has something which is quite narrowly defined and treated the mentioned term as a Discipline (Ekanayake and Fox, 2010). This present report is based on two new stories of computing and these stories have been analysed with the help of using the Actor Network Theory. This is an essay preview perceiving reader to know about modern computing which does not act in isolation. </p> <h5>Actor Network Theory and its relevancy</h5> <p>Actor Network Theory (ANT) is becoming common among the information system researchers as this study argues regarding the utility of actor- network theory as a conceptual framework for information system researcher. This actor network theory is an approach to the social theory which originates in the field of social science which generally treats objects as a part of social networks (Munro, 2009). Further, this ANT is considered as a constructive approach and it generally avoids essential explanations for all new events and innovations. This theory further makes relationship with those entities who are dealing in the fields of sociology and anthropology. Moreover, there is generally one aspect which makes this theory applicable for the field of information system research as this theory contradict different between the human and non- human entities in ontological level. Further, this Actor Network Theory is in graphical format and generally there are two views of this theory. The first view in this is of the network of actors for a particular time refereed as a network theory model and it is a freeze frame process. (Alcadipani and Hassard, 2010). On the other hand, the second view reflecting up the dynamics nature of the actor network and it is generally shown as a time line with relevant events which are usually recorded and referenced to each of the actor network theory models which are visible on the time line. Moreover, these actors have to be considered in their own rights and can never be intermediary who simply relying an effect of one entity to another without transforming. Moreover, these actors in actor network theory can be human, technology and even can be intangible actors (Munro, 2009). </p> <h5>Two computing stories</h5> <p>“The computer that knows what you’re thinking” </p> <p>This theory plays a crucial role and the story which has been undertaken in this scenario is of computer and the individual. Here from the view point of actor network theory, Computer is an actor and person who is using it acts as an actant. Here, the feeling and emotions of individuals is understood by the computer and it starts processing in the way which person wants too (Farias and Bender, 2012). Moreover, human being is full of emotions and technology and innovation comes up to extend that it has started knowing our gestures and the things which we want from the same to do. Further, being human only we surplus these types of feelings and we are just lucky to have it. This theory has been practically implemented by the researcher who has developed emotion reading computers. It is generally an innovation in the field of IT where machines includes emotional intelligence and also the everyday objects which are generally empathized with our daily routine moods (Venturini, 2010). It is not the actual sense that computer will identify but it will something relate to the same as fridge offers you the food when someone is hungry or a mirror who also knows the way how one looks like, etc., Further, emotions like joy and fear from the web cam in computer has bee detracted which shows a wide range of different facial moments of an individual right from frowning to smiling. These emojis are also included in the text messages where one can sent his/her feelings to other. Activities of the actants plays a crucial role in shaping up this theory and the individuals have to be act according to it in order to implement this theory in a significant manner. Further, cultural differences have also revealed up that there is a big difference in the emotional response between the men and women and also between the different age groups and demographics. Smiles of actant also differ from the situation to the situation as someone is angry and one make him smile then the same will not the actual which usually comes in a general way (Ostermann, and et.al, 2010). Further, emotions in the actant are generally very complex and the way individuals express change in the different settings. Moreover, researcher are not trying to build a computer who is much better than an expert because currently the technology is at a level of a children and it will take lot of time to understand the feeling of the actant. Further, there might some issues which can affect the performance of such computers as keeping the privacy guard apart from the emotions. Further, with the failure as if no emotions is detected by user can include huge cost. Further, individual feelings differ from person to person and apart from all the major feelings if something else is described by the individual then computer will not be able to give the best of the response. </p> </div> </section> </div> <!--our work or portfolio section end--> </div> <br> <br> <br> <br> <!--body content wrap end--> <?php include "footer.php";?>
