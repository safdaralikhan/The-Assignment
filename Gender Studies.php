                <h5>Introduction</h5>
                <p>Queer refers to those communities that are physically different from other general public and those
                    mindsets and preferences also differ in great extent. Legalisation of Homosexuality has been debated
                    since its very inception and there are people who are for and as well as against same-sex marriage
                    (Cornwall and Lindisfarne, 2016). The following report is on understanding this debate in Australia by
                    undertaking queer analysis. It covers the biological and social factors regarding queer as well as
                    positive and negative factors of same-sex marriage that helps in gaining a wider understanding of this
                    community as well as homosexual marriages.
                </p>
                <p>TASK 1
                </p>
                <p>What could a queer analysis bring to an understanding of the debates about same-sex marriage in
                    Australia?
                </p>
                <p>Queer, traditionally used as a a term to denote homosexuality, now refers to both people attracted to
                    individuals of same sex and people whose bodies and sexualities do not conform with dominant norms of
                    society. This term clearly explores disagreements between anatomical sex, gender identity and sexual
                    desires. The debate of same sex-marriage in Australia is quite old. This debate has been prominent for
                    the political agenda. Even after this debate has been subjected to varied opinions from the community
                    and politics, still it is controversial and complex in the country. Queer analysis could clearly be
                    understood by Queer Theory, which introduces the idea of “heteronormativity”, a term that undertakes
                    promotion of heterosexuality as a normal sexual orientation. As far as the debate of same sex marriage
                    is considered, Howard Government in 2004 limited the marriage between a woman and a man. However, in
                    2017, Australian Government passed the bill for same sex marriage. The arguments that were presented
                    were quite concrete on both sides of the debate. While the minority referred to Catholic religion where
                    marriage is restricted to a man and a woman, the majority debated about the equality given to
                    individuals regarding their marriage (Vivar, 2016). However, queer analysis could be a relevant source
                    of understanding the same sex debate. According to the analysis, there are multiple perspective that
                    interrelates this aspect to various other concepts like biological and social. As far as the biology is
                    concerned, the analysis focused on the the atypical combination of X and Y chromosomes which is quite
                    natural for them to be different and have contrast sexual characteristics. Where the social concept is
                    concerned, the analysis helps in understanding the behaviour of individuals. As per various theories, an
                    individuals’ self identity is not born with them but rather constructed through repeated practices. As
                    far as homosexuality is concerned, their likings and sexual preferences are dependant upon their
                    identity which is developed through repetitive behavioural and physical practices preferred by those
                    individuals. For the debate in Australia, it is quite important, that both these aspects be understood
                    by the individuals who are against same-sex marriage and it must be considered as a union of two
                    individuals rather than just man and woman. There must be an understanding of the biological
                    characteristics of these individuals to gain a better understanding of their behaviour. Such
                    understanding would allow them to look past the cultural and societal norms and would allow them to
                    accept these marriages and consider them as a natural activity. Moreover, the right of choice must be
                    given to each and every Australian citizen by the government which would give them supreme authority to
                    choose the partner they want to marry. In addition, discrimination must be ended for homosexual people
                    and proper sex education must be given to children and the teenagers to promote equality and better
                    insight on the concept of homosexuality (Wodak and Benke, 2017). The debate even after its legalisation
                    is still ongoing in the country. Queer analysis also helped individuals and communities in giving a
                    wider look at the domains which would be affected after same-sex marriage. A report by Family Research
                    Council has focused on few elements which makes this debate far from being over. The most important
                    factor that has been focused upon the council were children. Homosexual couples use methods like
                    surrogacy and In-vitro fertilisation (IVF) to conceive children. These methods however make these
                    children away from their biological parents. In this manner, same sex marriage often has a bad impact on
                    children as they are bound to be away from their parents and are often not even introduced which worsen
                    the situation (Buikema, Plate and Thiele, 2017). Secondly, each parent has a crucial role to play in
                    lives of children. Homosexuality eradicates this fulfilment of this desire in children which causes
                    psychological disturbance in their minds. In addition to this, there have been quite few instances that
                    has been reported which suggests that children that are raised by homosexual couples might experience
                    sexual and gender disorders. This evidence became even stronger when it was analysed how young children
                    raised by homosexual couples end up being in homoerotic relationships. This further eliminates the
                    rights of choices due to uneven proportions of gender prescriptions due to homosexual parenting.
                    Thirdly, the major concern of same sex marriage is upon the sexual fidelity between couples. Quiet
                    recently, a research of civil unions provided evidence on the facts that almost 79 percent of people
                    valued sexual fidelity against only 50 percent homosexual couples. There is much need of extramarital
                    outlets in homosexual couples than in heterosexual. This factor again votes against the same-sex
                    marriage (Ten Arguments From Social Science Against Same-Sex Marriage, 2019). With such strong and
                    influencing factors working against same-sex marriage, there are evidences too that are covered under
                    queer analysis suggesting benefits associated with homosexual marriages. The first benefit is the legal
                    rights protection of partners. The legalisation of same-sex marriage provides ample benefits to couples
                    where finances, taxes and healthcare services are concerned. They enjoy all the monetary as well as
                    legal benefits as a heterosexual couple which provides them psychological satisfaction as they become
                    legally accepted. Legalisation of same-sex marriages also has an impact on the stigma and discrimination
                    faced by homosexual individuals as along with the society, these marriages get acceptance by the state
                    too, making them as important for individuals as any other kind of marriage. Queer analysis also has a
                    clear intake on how positively same sex marriage impacts children. Legalising these marriages would help
                    homosexual couples train their mentally untainted children in a way that they grow up to be beneficial
                    to their parents as well as the society. It would help the secure next generation effectively. For
                    Australia, same sex marriage could benefit the economy too. The events and wedding industry could
                    experience lots of economic benefits by same sex marriages. Moreover, it is beneficial for business
                    providers as well. It also benefits the tourism industry as homosexual couples could effectively travel
                    different places to stage their wedding. Since this marriage has been legalised in Australia, the
                    government has witnessed quite of lot weddings in just one year since its legalisation. More than 5900
                    marriages were registered across the country up-till November, 2017 (Thousands of couples have tied the
                    knot since Australia legalised same-sex marriage, 2019). These marriages have had a wide impact on the
                    economy of Australia. The benefits associated with same-sex marriage are quite crucial for the society
                    as well as the economy as a whole. Individuals and communities in Australia who are against same sex
                    marriage and LGBTQ community must analyse these benefits and undergo queer analysis in order to develop
                    understanding and logical reasoning for the government legalising same-sex marriage in the country. Even
                    if there are many negative aspects as well as limitations associated with these marriages, efforts must
                    be taken to effectively handle the situations and ensure better development of homosexual couples as
                    well as their children. Various educational and social programmes must be held in a way that it informs
                    and encourage people into completely eradicate the discrimination towards these communities (Hancock,
                    2016). With educational enhancements and emphasis on equality, legalisation of same sex marriage in
                    Australia would be quite effective in the long run as there would be a new way and a complete different
                    ideology of how queer as well as homosexual people are viewed in the country (Blumenfeld, 2017). In
                    addition to this, same sex marriage also would be considered in a positive and a healthy lifestyle which
                    would contribute in psychological and personal development of individuals of this community by making
                    them exercise their equal rights effectively (Martinsson and Griffin, 2016).</p>
                <h5>Conclusion
</h5
>
                <p>Thus, it is concluded that queer analysis is quite imperative to gain a deeper understanding of same sex
                    marriages. The biological as well as social factors regarding queer community could really help other
                    individuals in understanding the behaviour and preferences of homosexual community. Queer analysis also
                    helps in gaining an insight on the positive and negative factors of same-sex marriage that have an
                    impact on the communities and countries as a whole. However, individuals and governments might consider
                    positive impacts of homosexual marriage and must give individuals right of free choice and inform and
                    educate others to mitigate the risk of discrimination and encouragement of equal treatment.
