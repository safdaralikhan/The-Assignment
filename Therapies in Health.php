                    Health And Social Care
                </h3>
                <h5>Introduction
                </h5>
                <p>Complementary therapy is known as alternative medicine, holistic therapy and traditional medicine in
                    which different services are delivered to the patients in unique manner. There are many types of
                    treatment that typically exit under complementary therapy and which also involves conventional medical
                    system (Barcelona de Mendoza, Harville, Savage and Giarratano, 2016). Most popular therapies are
                    aromatherapy, acupuncture, herbal medicine and yoga. These therapies are important in the realm of
                    health and social care because it underpins the practices of service delivery process. Therefore, in
                    this respect discussion has been made on types of complementary benefits and how it aids in improving
                    the life of a person. The entire study has been made on Lifeline which is entitled in delivering
                    complementary therapy services; thus in such respect focus has been laid on role of complementary
                    therapies in orthodox treatment. Furthermore, discussion is also included regarding reliability and
                    validity of information sources on complementary therapy. Lastly, discussion has been made about use of
                    existing legislation and code of ethics which helps in regulating complementary therapies in society.

                        <p>Herbal medicine is also regarded as herbalism which includes botanical medicine wherein plants or
                            plant extracts are applied to skin to treat any patient (Gregory and et.al., 2017). This is also
                            a traditional method that could be used by Lifeline to treat illness. At the same time, it also

                            rendered especially to patients suffering from depression (Carpenter, Webb, Bostock and Coomber,
                            2017). Appropriate discussion is held among patient and counsellor at Lifeline so as to discuss

                            (Johns, Bobat and Holder, 2016). It is usually given to patients having problems related to acne

                            generally given to older patients at Lifeline. Cupping therapy is one of the examples of

                <p>1.3 Analyze the factors that influence the access to complementary therapies
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Geographical factors: Lifeline is located far away from the city side; hence patients find it difficult to reach the health care centre (Stub and et.al., 2016). Thus, due to geographical distance, many patients do not get suitable services.
                    </li>
                    <li>Socio-economic factors: Apparently, complementary services are costly; therefore some patients find it difficult to get access for the same treatment. In this respect, it is clear that due to unavailability of economic sources, most often patients do not get the opportunity for proper psychological treatment (Tussing and Wren, 2017).
                    </li>
                    <li>Cultural factors: There are various people who do not prefer to undergo for complementary therapies due to their social and cultural values. For instance â€“ most of the youngsters do not go to counsellors as they get insecure about their social status.
                    </li>
                    <li>Educational factors: Todayâ€™s world is technologically integrated; however still there are varied patients who do not have proper knowledge and education about complementary services (Carpenter, Webb, Bostock and Coomber, 2017). Hence, this is another factor that reduces the chances of easy access of complementary services.
                    </li>
                    <li>Referral systems: Complementary services are sometimes given through reference basis; therefore many people do not find it reliable; hence they do not get access for the same.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Task 2
                </p>
                <p>2.1 Compare the role of complementary therapies in orthodox treatment
                </p>
                <p>Orthodox treatment involves greater use of drugs and medicines to treat the patients; however there are various health problems which can be treated effectively through combining complementary therapies. For instance-
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Muscular skeletal disorder:</b> It is also known as carpal tunnel syndrome which creates injuries or pain in joints, muscles, ligaments, neck, back and tendons. Usually, the disorder is treated through drugs; however Lifeline can also make use of complementary therapy to treat specific health issue (Graham and Gray, 2016). In this respect, assistance can be acquired from Osteopathy therapy which involves massage to the bones and affected muscles. Therefore, along with Orthodox treatment, health care practitioners of Lifeline can ensure that proper massage and bone relaxation techniques are being used to treat the patient effectively.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Metabolic disorder:</b> Inherited metabolic disorders are based on genetic conditions and that also results in metabolism problems (Johns, Bobat and Holder, 2016). It usually depicts defective gene which results in enzyme deficiency. Lifeline complementary services are required to consider appropriate delivery of drugs and medicines so that such deficiency could be improved balanced. For example- patient having diabetes can switch to complementary services such as to Chromium which may improve in controlling diabetes. Chromium is required for a diabetic for the purpose of making glucose tolerance factor and at the same time it also helps insulin to generate positive results (McFeeters, Pront, Cuthbertson and King, 2016). Apart from this, Ginseng can also be given to the patient who have some glucose- lowering effects in different stages.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Thus, from the above discussion it is clear that with the help of complementary and orthodox services, prominent services could be delivered by Lifeline in different areas. Another instance â€“ problems in endocrine functioning can also affect a personâ€™s capability in managing diverse activities and practices.
                </p>
                <p>2.2 Evaluate the attitudes in general towards complementary therapies
                </p>
                <p>People have developed different perception regarding complementary therapies; however it differs according to positive and negative attitude. Some people have developed positive attitude about complementary services as they have accepted the benefits of the same. In this area, many people say that because of complementary therapies, there are distinct health problems which have solved yet (Hu and et.al., 2016). Furthermore, people have also accepted the services because complementary services of Lifeline are easily available. Along with this, people also consider complementary services beneficial because it does not have side effects. People also have a perception that complementary services are enjoyable especially during massage and other relaxing services (Johns, Bobat and Holder, 2016). However, on the other hand some people have negative attitude as well regarding complementary therapies because of less information. Lack of education and knowledge is one of the apparent factors that changes the mind-set of people towards diverse health care services. Further, most of the people also consider it time consuming activity because the outcomes which it gives takes too much time. Thus, according to the negative and positive perception, it is clear that people have difference of opinion about complementary therapy; hence this also changes the opportunities of access. It is also identified that due to cultural values and norms, some people do not prefer to get assistance from counsellors and therapies; thus they only prefer to get treatment through drugs (Kerr and et.al., 2016). At the same time, people also believe that complementary therapy services do not have any specific cure; hence less people get access for the same.
                </p>
                <p>2.3 Assess the psychological effects of complementary therapies
                </p>
                <p>Complementary therapies have several psychological effects; however this varies as per the health problems and disorders (Barcelona de Mendoza, Harville, Savage and Giarratano, 2016). For instance- a college going student is facing mental health issues because of depression; hence for the same the patient needs to get assistance from counselling services so that to come out with all the internal problems. At the same time, it can also be said that because of depression, the person is feeling lonely and isolated; hence with the help of suitable counselling services, all such issues could be managed accordingly. In terms of stating about psychological effects, it is evident that counsellors can enhance the comfort zone of the patient so that the problems could be revealed. Similarly, this can also aid the patient to feel better after disclosing all the health problems. Hence, counselling not only improves mental status; but also it encourages the person to switch towards a healthy and balanced life (Carpenter, Webb, Bostock and Coomber, 2017). Another example can be quoted here of a patient having learning disabilities. At the time of managing such patient, Lifeline is required to make use of alternative techniques (under complementary therapy) so that interest of patient can be identified in the same care provision. This is also useful for the purpose of involving the patient in care services. Thus, in order to treat autistic patients, health care practitioners of Lifeline are required to focus on psychological therapies suitably (Graham and Gray, 2016). This involves close monitoring, suitable communication and direct interaction with the patient; hence this is one of the most effective methods of dealing with autistic patients.
                </p>
                <p>2.4 Explain what contraindications present between orthodox and complementary therapies
                </p>
                <p>On the basis of general terminology, a contraindication is a specific situation wherein a drug or surgical procedure cannot be used because of its harmful effects to the person. There are basically two types of contraindications such as relative contraindication and absolute contraindication (Gregory and et.al., 2017). It is also the opposite of indication which gives a justifiable reason to use a specific treatment. Absolute contraindication means that there is no reasonable circumstance to undertake any course of action. For instance- when children have viral infection, they should not be given aspirin because it develops the risk of Reyeâ€™s syndrome. This might also enhance allergy in the child. The other category is relative contraindication in which the patient is at a risk of developing more complications; however such risks may be balanced by adopting different measures of health management. For example- in pregnancy, women usually avoid getting X-rays; however such risks may be balanced through proper diagnosis of any other serious health issue (Hu and et.al., 2016). Contrary to the same, it can be said that in order to treat an autistic patient, it is essential for the health care practitioners to focus more on complementary therapies as compared to orthodox treatment. In this situation, contraindication should be avoided as delivery of drugs and medicines can affect the patient differently. Thus, assistance could only be delivered through complementary therapies.
                </p>
                <p>Task 3
                </p>
                <p>3.1 Analyse the reliability and validity of information sources on complementary therapy
                </p>
                <p>Validity of an assessment is the degree which measures all such aspects which are supposed to be measured. This is different with that to reliability up to an extent and it also gives measurement results which are typically very much consistent (Johns, Bobat and Holder, 2016). However, on the other hand reliability is considered as the degree to which an assessment tool helps in producing stable and consistent results and outcomes. Both the terms (reliability and validity) are useful for the purpose of defining the accuracy aspects of information. Apart from this, there are different sources which are useful to provide information to people regarding complementary services such as internet, radio, journals and newspapers (Kerr and et.al., 2016). Articulating all the sources, Lifeline can make use internet and published articles to generate awareness among people regarding the availability of complementary services. However, prior using any source, it is essential for Lifeline to emphasize on all such factors that make the source valid and reliable (London, Muller, Handlin, HarlÃ©n, Lindmark and EkstrÃ¶m, 2016). For instance- before getting any information from internet sources, it is vital to analyse the authencity and accuracy aspects as that only makes the source highly reliable. In addition to the same, while getting information about any profession, it is crucial to focus on expertise advice and opinion so that level of accuracy and authencity can be defined. Proper emphasis should also be laid on the type of information as that could only allow the user to implement the information in requisite area (McFeeters, Pront, Cuthbertson and King, 2016).
                </p>
                <p>3.2 Evaluate the evidence
                </p>
                <p>The above picture of the journal is depicting usefulness of yoga in treating diabetes. The study also states that yoga is one of the most effective complementary therapies which aids diabetic patients to control the level of glucose in the body (McVicar, Greenwood, Ellis and LeForis, 2016). At the same time, it also ensures to keep balance in the body functioning through use of diverse exercises.
