Batteries, in which electricity is stored in chemical form can be recharged and reused as a source of power. Battery technology can be used for clearing and accelerating the path to a more energy dependent and greener framework. In the present report, a general overview of the battery cell has been provided. The report discusses the method which helps in the conversion of chemical energy into electrical energy. Differentiation has been made between the primary and secondary cell types. An attempt has been made to compare and contrast carbon-zinc, lead-acid and alkaline batteries.</p> <br> </div> <br> <br> <br> <br> <!--our work or portfolio section start--> <?php include "footer.php"; ?>
