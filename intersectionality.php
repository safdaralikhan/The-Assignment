                <h5>Critical analysis of intersectional representational of gender and race
</h5
>
                <p>The selected article is about Race, gender, class and intersectionality (Bhandar. B 2013). This article
                    is selected because it help in exploring the key debate related to intersectionality on race and gender.
                    It has been noted by one of the speaker that the way organised left contingents at recent anti- fascist
                    demos against the English defence league. Further there are most of the while people in British national
                    party and this was need to be cultivated an anti- racist politics on the left which include people of
                    race. Black women always knowns as the hard-working women and but they were not paid for their worth. It
                    has been suggested that one of the main reason for this absence is known as the perception among
                    different people of colour (Weigand, Webb and Mills, 2016.). This one of is left because socialist
                    organisation and parties have had, and regularly not have good record of taking issues in to
                    consideration seriously of gender and race. If race should be taken seriously then it required more than
                    one mentioning the word that is anti- racism and it also declare that racism take place.
                </p>
                <h5>Conceptual framework
</h5
>
                <p>The gender and race inequality take place but some people still not believe on gender and race
                    inequality. But it is a big role in students education in all over the world. It has been observed that
                    black people were not treated equally in politics and racism and sexism is still now alive all over the
                    world. The present report reflects the way to stop the gender and race inequality in the politics and
                    workplace at different levels (Sanchez-Peña, Main and McGee, 2016,). Women are always fundamentally
                    different from the men it is so because of their ability to bear children. There are several root cause
                    of gender inequality and the way this all issues faced by women at same time. Further it has been
                    discovered that gender inequalities is central to societies for centuries and the race is known as the
                    modern idea. Some of people believe that group of people who are similar physiological characteristics
                    constitute races. However the race is a system which is imposed by the political, cultural and
                    historical. Hence it can be stated that a black and while person can be have more in common that two
                    people of the same race. Apart from this black women are not paid fairly and according to their work
                    (Elhuni, Wilcox and Merritt, 2016.). They also experience poverty at higher rates as compared to black
                    men and women who belong to other ethnic and racial.
                </p>
                <h5>Representing inequality
</h5>
                <p>This article show inequality which is done with the black women at the work place, in politics and
                    societies. Black women were not treated as equal as other racism within the societies and work place.
                    Further it has been noted that black women’s relationship to both paid labour and unpaid work in home is
                    importantly contrary as compared to men. It is contrary developed and equally essential theme which
                    concerns the way black women unpaid family is at the same time confining and appoint black women (Herron
                    and Rosenberg, 2016.). Further it was found that the home and domestic work is knowns as the key sites
                    of women relationship. This above discussion show that inequality is not justifiable. However it show
                    the way in ignoring the ways through which women of colour have out of demand integrated their claims
                    for equality, redistribution and recognition. It means that it is not possible to separates all of these
                    out analytically and practically at the time when sexism and racism is ready to constitute the specific
                    form of class exploitation which is faced and experienced. Further black women are critiqued modes of
                    analysis which fail to consider the way gender and race cannot be kept analytically different if one
                    understand the persecution operated along these axes as in the interlinking manner. Black women are
                    continuously working for a better their nation, but nation are not working for them. If black women’s
                    experience and interest in the forefront of policy changes and social movements then it is easy to
                    address all the barrier (Gross, Gottburgsen and Phoenix, 2016.). One of the other example, which is
                    taken of an group who are incorporated and analysis of race and gender into her work. Author argued that
                    the making of the working class is only possible by the help of capitalist system which is committed to
                    both racism and sexism. From the process of divisions and differences with the working class which is
                    built on the basis of gender and race became constitutive of class rule and the planning of modern
                    working class (Sapon-Shevin, Brimhall-Vargas and Nieto, 2017).</p>
                <h5>Different, otherness and superiority
</h5>
                <p>To build a basic left political movement or network which means to take gender and racism inequality
                    seriously. Further there is a great instances of solidarity and activism betwixt left a particular
                    campaign and left organisation. In a different context the attempt of the organisers of the historical
                    materialism meeting to report for race and gender which is showed in the stream being organised on race
                    (Mandel and Semyonov, 2016.). The Black radical tradition and Marxist legacies of anti racism is taken
                    into consideration for black women’s rightist policy and critical indigenous theory were remain one of
                    the big hindrance on which advance being made on this front . For instances of socialist feminist work
                    which was failed. Further all its problems related to the racism and gender is one of the core part of
                    its analysis. The organiser not think that feminism not think that it is essential to include women of
                    different colour or scholars who basically deals with both race and gender (Chmielewski, Fine and
                    Stoudt, 2016.). Superiority
                </p>
                <p>Different ways due to which women are neglected because of their colour have out necessity integrated
                    their claims for equality and redistribution. Therefore it is not easy to separate on the basis of
                    colour because racism and discrimination is always ready to constitute the specific form of class
                    exploitation which one is faced with it (Chmielewski, Belmonte and Stoudt, 2016.). One of the reason of
                    failure of this approach is that universalise the experience of middle class women, white and other .
                    Hence it means that experience of black women, and indigenous women and Asian women are removed by the
                    politics of left and theories feminisms. It means that all the problem which is analysed of political
                    are not correct. It is so because capitalism was imitative through complex legal ouster, and third world
                    labour whose value stay fixed at the some degree by racism and a continual belief in white superiority.
                </p>
                <p>Differentiation is still done between people in context to the race and gender. There are many black
                    women who work hard for their family but they do not get fair pay for their work (Weigand, Webb and
                    Mills, 2016). Further there are some theory which help in removing inequality which take place at
                    different sector of that is organisation, education and others.
                </p>
                <h5>Overarching message of the piece
</h5
>
                <p>From the article it reflects that some of the criticism are intersectionality and take place in the
                    liberal anti racism purposes. Further, the main reason of this absence is the thinking of people related
                    to colour due to which socialist parties need to continued it a poor tracking take place so that record
                    taking issues of race and racism seriously (Sanchez-Peña, Main and McGee, 2016). For taking the anti
                    discrimination more seriously it is important to gather some knowledge about it and find out the analyse
                    problems . Further, it is critically assessed that an identity based politics of recognition which lead
                    to create inequality among the people . The intersectionality have long emphasized that the comparison
                    is made between women on the basis of their race and ethnicity.
                </p>
                <h5>Link back to theoretical debater and conclusion
</h5
>
                <p>From the above report it can be concluded that Black women are always knowns as the hard working women
                    and they did not get pay according to their work. This show that women are always discriminated at each
                    field . Further it also conclude that rethink the concepts which is used at the time when it required to
                    explain the political event. It is not important to only know about the anti racism. It is required to
                    think about the security which is needed so that discrimination can be removed from all over the world.
                    Issues related to income inequality need to be taken into consideration so that men and women not
                    treated unequally. From the report it show that racism and gender discrimination is not removed from all
                    over the world. There are some theories which help in understanding and removing this type of
                    discrimination so that all people can be treated fairly.
