                </h3>
                <h5>Introduction
                </h5>
                <p>Business organization now a days focuses on the packaging and labelling of the products so that they can
                    attract number of customers towards companies services. The food industry pack the items so that they
                    can protect them from the external environment. Packaging is a factor through which the enterprise can
                    advertise and promote their products. Further, they will be able to create a strong base of customers
                    and they can also earn profits in the market. If packaging is proper then people will be able to know
                    about the information of goods. The present report is based on HP Food Limited which perform its
                    operations in food industry. They focuses on the packaging of their products (Robertson, 2016). The
                    below mentioned report is based on the packaging of the products that help the firm in order to achieve
                    their objectives. Along with this, it also explains that how these factors may influence the evaluation
                    test. Furthermore, it also explains that how decisions can be evaluated and test can be used by an
                    enterprise.
                </p>
                <p>TASK 1
                </p>
                <p>The current demand for packaged food
                </p>
                <p>The demand of the packaged food is increasing in the market and through this companies global image is
                    also get improved (Mahalik and Nambiar, 2010). Along with the income of people their need for packaged
                    good is also increased. Now people are conscious for their health so they prefer to buy goods that have
                    proper packaging because through this they will be able save their health from the outside world. Now
                    packaging of the commodities is different from the last 20 to 30 years at that time people are not that
                    much conscious for their health. In the past years, the scope of the internet is not wide so companies
                    will not be able to offer their services at global level. So, they donâ€™t focus on the packaging (Duncan,
                    2011).
                </p>
                <p>The main packaging materials used in the food processing industry
                </p>
                <p>HP Food Limited can use some of the packaging materials in order to pack the products so that overall
                    goals can be accomplished. The right kind of material and technology can improve the brand image of the
                    firm because through this quality of the products can be maintained. Some of these material are glass,
                    metal, plastics, paper and paper board (Hawkes, 2010). By using these stuff, a retail industry pack the
                    products so that safety of the food can be increased. The manager can also conduct a research in the
                    market so that they will be able to identify the factors that may affect the packaging of the food (The
                    functions of packaging.2011).
                </p>
                <p>How packaging is useful for the industry
                </p>
                <p>The packaging of the products is important for the food industry because through this they will be able
                    to protect the goods (Silvestre, Duraccio and Cimmino, 2011). If packaging is good then its quality can
                    be maintained for a longer period and along this their safety can be ensured. Through this, the industry
                    can protect the food item from the chemical and biological factors. Along with this, this will also
                    reduce the wastage of food items in the environment and it save the good from the environmental factors.
                    It will increase the convenience for the users and it minimize the efforts of the customers. Innovative
                    packaging can increase the sales in the market and through this consumers will be able to know about the
                    features of the products.
                </p>
                <p>Packaging is depends upon the food item
                </p>
                <p>HP Food Limited has to pack their items on the basis of the type of food so that their freshness can be
                    retained for a long time (Yam and Lee, 2012). There are some items like vegetables, high fat content
                    products and high moisture products. The packaging of these items are difficult for the food industry
                    because they have to attract more consumers by providing them healthy and safe products. Through these,
                    they will be able to improve their global business in an efficient manner.
    
                </p>
                <p>Describe the layer and purpose of the packaging
                </p>
                <p>UHT milk is the most common product that is consumed by the people of United Kingdom. For this, the firm
                    use pasteurized process so that quality of the product can be ensured and for its packaging the food
                    industry uses tetra pak shelf safe carton (Siracusa, 2012). Some of the layers of this product are the
                    first layer of this product seals in the liquid, adhesion layer, aluminium foil, paper and last it
                    covered in the top layer. The purpose of this type of packaging is to provide the safe and healthy
                    products to the customers. Through this, transportation of the heavy products can be easy for the food
                    industry.
                </p>
                <p>Achieve a long life product with an approximate shelf life of 6 to 9 months
                </p>
                <p>The packaging of products is an important tool that is used by the food industry so that they can save
                    their goods from the environmental changes, pollution, manufacturing date and expiry date. These
                    organization can use MAP(modified atmosphere packaging) technique so that products can be preserved for
                    a long time. In this technique, the firm insert the gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen in
                    order to preserve the products (Kirwan and Strawbridge, 2011). On the basis of this the company can
                    offer fresh and safe food items to the people of the country for a long period.
                </p>
                <p>Compare the packaging of different products
                </p>
                <p>There are three types of packaging of the products with proper labelling so that customers will be able
                    to know about the product information. The first one is showing the packaging of the products in cane
                    and its outer layer is made by the metal. The another product is showing the packing of the products in
                    a plastic wrapper on which all the information is given about the product. In the last product the
                    product is packed in a glass bottle with the proper information. Through these packaging the food can be
                    preserved.
                </p>
                <p>For MAP packaging processes describe the effect of the each gas
                </p>
                <p>In MAP technology, the firm uses the different gases such as oxygen, nitrogen and carbon dioxide in order
                    to preserve the product for a long time. When these gases get mixed with each other then they only they
                    can preserve the goods for their customers. Along with this, this mixture is depend upon the type of
                    product and their packaging (Food Packaging Materials.2017). Through these chemicals product can be
                    preserved for a long duration (Mihindukulasuriya and Lim, 2014). Furthermore, on its packaging the firm
                    can provide the information regarding to the products its manufacturing and expiry date.
                </p>
                <p>Packaging methods and technologies designed to extend shelf life
                </p>
                <p>Greggs plc can use different type of packaging methods and technologies so that self life can be extended
                    of the products. The food industry can use field packing, shed packing and repacking in order to provide
                    the products through the world. These packaging should be used by the organization so that food items
                    can be protected from the virus, bacteria and listeria. If food products are in the contact of the
                    environment than through the environmental factors these pathogens can be grow in the products (Raheem,
                    2013). The freshness of the product can be identified by the sensory organs.
                </p>
                <p>What improvements can you foresee occurring in the packaging industry?
                </p>
                <p>In future, these packaging industry can gain success in the market as compare to other market players.
                    Through this the food industry will be able to increase the level of satisfaction among all the
                    customers. Supply chain network can be designed in a more efficient manner so that their overall
                    performance can be improved (Williams and WikstrÃ¶m, 2011). Relationship between customers and
                    organization can be improved. Furthermore, companies will be able to increase their profits and decrease
                    the cost. On the basis of some factors the food industry will be able to improve their actual
                    performance as compare to the standards.
                </p>
                <p>What are some of the factors that can impact on a foods quality even before it is packaged?
                </p>
                <p>The quality of food is get affected due to some factors these can be related to the environment,
                    moisture, atmosphere and temperature. When products are manufactured then the manager of HP Food Limited
                    has to focus on these factors so that safe products can be delivered to the customers. Along with this,
                    he has to focus on the sensory factors so that its quality can be ensured in an efficient manner. These
                    all factors should be managed properly so that overall quality of the food item can be improved (Jung,
                    Puligundla and Ko, 2012).
                </p>
                <p>Good practices allow us to work well within a culturally diverse workplace
                </p>
                <p>Every business organization perform its operations in the environment so that overall needs of the
                    customers can be fulfilled. Some of the practices that are performed by the food industry such as top
                    leadership commitments, recruitment, succession planning and diversity training. Through these
                    approaches the firm will be able to perform well in the culturally diverse workplace and accomplish all
                    their objectives (Blanco and Siracusa, 2013). The manager of HP Food Limited can involve its employees
