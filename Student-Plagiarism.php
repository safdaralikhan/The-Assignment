                <h3>Report on Student Plagiarism And Professional Practice
                </h3>
                <h5>Student plagiarism and professional practice
</h5>
                <p>The internet is the biggest and foremost source of information which can be accessed easily to retrieve
                    any type of information. This has made internet most preferred source for collecting information by any
                    person regardless of his/ her age. I have seen that nowadays, various projects in schools and colleges
                    that are asked from students to make are not done in a proper way. They are just plagiarised from
                    various internet sources without any original researches. The plagiarism refers to naming others’ work
                    as own. The projects assigned to students has the purpose of increasing knowledge from practical aspect
                    along with enhancement of research work. In case of nursing education I have seen this problem which is
                    more fierce where generally, seniors use to plagiarise or name the work of their juniors as their own.
                    In UK this problem has enhanced at a high level in current situation (Falchikov, 2013). This issue has
                    an adverse impact on various pre and post nursing courses which ultimately degrades the professionalism
                    in students. The plagiarism has become an international issue where I found in UK that various nursing
                    professionals and midwifery councils are forced to maintain the reputation of health and care profession
                    along with corresponding to professional code of conduct. Various discussions that I have read and
                    researched about this issue has acknowledged me that the act of plagiarism has serious implications on
                    professionalism. Thus, it becomes necessary to find a solution for this challenging issue in the current
                    scenario as soon as possible (Roig, 2011). The basic meaning of plagiarism is to make others’ work own
                    without mentioning its credible source anywhere. Because of this, many institutions have considered this
                    act as cheating and also termed it as a serious offence. I have learnt that the act of plagiarism is a
                    big misconduct that should be avoided in any case. It is apparent in the current scenario that many
                    technological developments have been done in this field to restrict the practices of plagiarism. But I
                    found it very unfortunate that this issue is becoming more harder to control as students are using this
                    approach in more careful and sophisticated way. I referred the report of various recent medical councils
                    through which it was discovered that these councils have considered this issue in case of medical
                    students who are currently practising. Various senior associated who are concerned with this issue has
                    left this issue of fraud or plagiarism on individual medical schools (Lampert, 2014). Further, different
                    medical councils have commonly agreed that related authorities must make some new laws in this regard so
                    that this situation can be ameliorated. However, the authorities suggest that individual medical
                    councils and colleges may resolve this issue by constructing some rules by posing penalties as they
                    consider fit for restricting mentioned practice. By reading the article on plagiarism I have come to
                    know that this act is much serious concern in present time which should be resolved as soon as possible.
                    The reading of articles has asserted that plagiarism can be done through many ways which is most
                    probably comes out of group tasks. There are more possibilities in group works that student do their
                    work as a team and of them may claim the entire work as his own. Similarly, I have noted that most of
                    the times students use to help each other and submit their copied work from friends. Another way is
                    internet where nowadays many sites have come on internet which provide free or chargeable essays on
                    desired topics (Angélil-Carter, 2014). Thus, overall more than 30% students use to copy the material of
                    assignments and researches from internet and many other sources. In this concern, the professor of
                    Singapore has admitted this practice as Alteration and amendment. The problem has affected not only UK
                    but various other countries as well. As per the various researches and articles, I think that solution
                    to this problem can be developed with the help of moral principles. It is necessary for student s to
                    know about ethics and morality so that they can successfully decide that what is right an d what is
                    wrong. In various professions like nursing, before registration to become a professional practitioner,
                    it is necessary that student develops within themselves assorted ethical and moral principles (Elander
                    and et.al., 2010). The professional qualification of a student should not be just limited to their
                    degrees but it should be extended to honesty and trustworthiness as well. This is necessary as the
                    student who is indulging in plagiarism at any stage of learning and training will not gain the required
                    knowledge. This will be a definite loss for students and also for the institution promoting that
                    student. By the researches I found many reasons due to which students use to do plagiarism. In context
                    of nursing students, there is a difficult task for them to balance the life between academic practices
                    along with various competencies required in profession. Further, it is also manifested that in this
                    profession that many of the students entering this field are enough matured and married. As per this, it
                    becomes very difficult for them to manage the work of academics and their parental responsibilities
                    (Löfström & Kupila, 2013). Most of the times the work load become heavy which makes enough pressurising
                    for students to manage their work and maintaining quality in it. This becomes some obvious reason which
                    has increased the practice of plagiarism. For this, it is necessary to maintain basic values by the key
                    professionals so that they can develop the moral and necessary values within students whether thay are
                    entering in pre or post registration. In my point of view whatever be the reason of plagiarism, it
                    cannot lessen the impact and result of the act (Heitman & Litewka, 2011). But, it is necessary to remove
                    this issue from the scenario as bounding into a professional code of conduct and posing some penalties
                    will not fulfil the purpose in proper way. Here, the professionals and higher authorities should work as
                    a role model by keeping themselves as the example before students so that they can develop values and
                    ethics. This example of presenting the role model should be presented at each and every stage of
                    assigning work, giving seminars and sharing information. The ethical concern in this issue lies with
                    honesty which is necessary to be maintained. But involving in plagiarism leads to a kind of fraud
                    whether it is done on any stage (Jiang, Emmerton & McKauge, 2013). In context of health care profession,
                    I think this is a more serious concern as cheating at the time of learning or training may cause a
                    serious results for clients or patients in future. Various practical cases have seen in such scenario
                    where about 50% students have admitted the act of plagiarism in nursing profession intentionally or
                    unintentionally. This act leads a serious damage to the professionalism. Therefore, it is necessary to
                    take some strict steps that can restrict student to execute this act. For enhancing their professional
                    degree, students use to indulge in act of cheating which if discovered may lead to serious consequences.
                    I think, for this concern, it is necessary to develop changes in current practices so that students may
                    develop their interest in learning instead of cheating (Kift, Nelson & Clarke, 2010). To restrict the
                    practice of plagiarism, it is necessary to develop new policies and norms necessary to confine practice
                    of plagiarism. I also recommend that the institutions on individual basis and various councils commonly
                    develop some rules in this regard so that students can maintain transparency in their work. The
                    institutions may make a formal and common meeting among themselves to discuss the matter. The high
                    professionals should make students to understand the necessity of fairness in their work in present and
                    future context as well. The strict implementation of penalties in the case of plagiarism should be posed
                    which should be detected from highly efficient software (Xiao, 2010). In addition, the development of
                    ethical and moral concerns among students will be the most useful tool for restricting the practice of
                    plagiarism. By summarising the entire study, I found that the plagiarism is a serious concern that
                    should be solved as soon as possible. It is also evident that students who are under training in the
                    nursing profession also use to indulge in cheating which leads to fraudulent practices with clients. For
                    solving this problem it is necessary that the higher authorities set examples before students and
                    develop the sense of values and ethical behaviour so that work can be maintained without any plagiarism
                    (Evering & Moorman, 2012).
