                </p>
                <p>The airline industry can use other alternative strategies in order to improve their performance in the
                    market. These strategies are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Market entry: This is an appropriate strategy that is used by the organization in order to expand
                        their business in other market (Lussier and Corman, 2015). There are some strategies that are used

                        alliances. Through this, an enterprise can establish their business in another market so their brand
                        image can be improved.

                        growth. For this, the airline industry can use horizontal and vertical integration. Along with this,
                        they can also use diversification strategy in order offer new services into the new market. The
                        advantage of this theory is that they can increase their growth in future and through this they can
                        achieve success so their overall performance can be improved.
                    </li>
                    <li>Limited growth: This type of alternative approach can be used by British Airways so they their
                        problems that they are facing in the market (Ibrahim, Dumas and McGuire, 2015). Some of the issues
                        are related to the financial loss, low growth. So through this approach, the manager will be able to
                        improve their performance and overall goals can be accomplished. For this, they can use market
                        penetration and product development.
                    </li>
                    <li>Retrenchment: This strategy is used by the airline industry when they will not be able to increase
                        their market share due to high competition in the market. At this time, they can asset reduction
                        strategy, cost minimization strategy and revenue generation approach.

                <br>
                <p>TASK 3
                </p>
                <p>3.1 The roles and responsibilities of personnel (HR) for implementing a specific strategy
                </p>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>3.2 The estimated resource requirements for implementing a new strategy
                </p>
                <p>When British Airways implement a strategy then they need some resources such as human, financial, raw
                    material so that their overall performance can be improved. By using these, company can expand their
                    business in the market. These resources are: <b>Human resources:</b> These are an important asset of the
                    organization who help them in attaining the goals. Manager has to retain their workers in the
                    organization so that their overall performance can be improved and they will be able to gain more
                    benefits (Young and et.al., 2015). For this, manager of British Airways has to trained their employees
                    so that they can perform well. <b>Financial resources:</b> These resources are related to the capital, cost and
                    investment of the organization. Through these, British Airways will be able to purchase the material and
                    pay the salary to their employees on time. Along with this, manager can increase the satisfaction among
                    the workers. <b>Raw material:</b> These are material that are required to order to provide the quality services
                    to the customers. The manager can offer the quality and luxuries services to their passengers (Lai,
                    Melloni and Stacchezzini, 2016). If company will purchase raw material in bulk than they can minimize
                    their cost and through this profits will be maximized. <b>Technological resources:</b> These resources are
                    related to machine, tool, energy and so on. Through the technological advancements, firm will be able to
                    offer more innovative and quality services to their customer. All staff members should be trained so
                    that they can handle all the equipment in an efficient manner.
                </p>
                <p>3.3 The contribution of S.M.A.R.T targets to the achievement of strategy implementation
                </p>

                    achieve success in the market. These SMART objectives are stands for specific, measurable, achievable,
                    realistic, time. These are: <b>Specific:</b> All objectives should be clear and specific so employees will be
                    able to understand the goals (DeMartino and Barbato, 2015). Through this, they will be able to know that
                    how operations needs to be done and in what manner. For example, company can set a objective like to
                    increase the market by 1% at the end of the month. <b>Measurable:</b> Objectives should be set by the top
                    executives so that they can be measured in an efficient manner. Along with this, it is related to the
                    quality, quantity and the cost of the services. For example, British Airways can measure their
                    performance in every week so that future profits can be forecast. <b>Achievable:</b> The manager has to assess
                    their employees that they are able to perform the task in the business environment or not. Along with

                    employee set their goals then those targets should be realistic in every manner. If an organization
                    doesn’t have sufficient resources, time then they will not be able to improve their performance
                    (Trevisan, 2016). <b>Time bound:</b> Every objective should be set as per the time line or deadline so that
                    their overall performance can be improved. For example, British Airways can increase their market share
                    by the 10%. Here, 12 months is a time line

                    </li>

                <p><b>Opportunities:</b> These are the characteristics through which an organization can sustain their competitive
                    advantage in the market. These opportunities are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>British Airways can perform their operations in many other international destinations.

                </ul>
                <p>Environmental audit for British Airways
                </p>
                <p>Environmental audit is a tool that is used by the organization so that they can identify their position
                    in the market. Through this, British Airways will be able to identify the factors which may influence
                    their performance. For this, manager can use PESTLE analysis. These elements are: <b>Political and legal:</b>
                    These factors are related to the foreign exchange, trade activities and so on. If political stability is
                    their in country then British Airways will be able to improve their growth in other country. Along with
                    this, they have to follow some of the legal laws so that they can improve their performance. <b>Economical:</b>
                    These factors are related to the economic condition of the country as these can also affect the growth
                    of the airline industry (Ghezzi, Cortimiglia and Frank, 2015). For example, when oil prices get
                    increased then the price of ticket is also get increased. Social: These factors are related to the
                    needs, lifestyle, preferences and demand of their customers. So, the manager of British Airways has to
                    identify the requirements of their service users so their overall performance can be improved.
                    <b>Technological:</b> By using the technological advancements an organization will be able to attract their
                    customers towards their services. For example, the airline industry can use arrival management and
                    departure management system. <b>Environmental:</b> These factors are related to the environmental safety and
                    the organizations have to follow the rules that are made by the government. Now, government limit the
                    radiations and their growth.
                </p>
                <p>The significance of stakeholder analysis when formulating new strategy
                </p>
                <p>British Airways can use stakeholder analysis in order to identify their roles in the decision making
                    process. For this, manager can follow a systematic process. In the first step, manager identify the
                    people who are associated with their operations and their demands. People who have high power and high
                    interest they are closely associated with British Airways. On the other hand, if people have low
                    interest and low power then they are highly associated with the enterprise (Young and et.al., 2015).
                    Through this analysis, an enterprise will be able to role of stakeholders in the decision making
                    process.

                    of the organization as through this they can fulfill their goals. There are many factors which may
                    affect these strategies such as leadership, employees and so on. British Airways can use SWOT and pestle

                    QUESTION 3
                </h4>
                <h5>Interpreting the technical requirements and importance of international accounting standards
                </h5>
                <p>International Accounting standards have high level of importance which ensures high level transparency
                    and standardization in the financial statements. Hence, final accounts which are prepared according to
                    IFRS are highly reliable in nature and thereby helps stakeholders in making decisions (Florou, Kosi and
                    Pope, 2017). However, technical knowledge is highly required among the individuals or accounting
                    personnel to deal with the aspects of International Accounting Standards such as IAS 12 and 26 etc. In
                    this, accounting personnel must have ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities. Moreover,
                    assets, revenue received in advance, other liabilities, unrecognized items; consolidated financial
                    statements are the main bases of taxation (Warren, 2016). By taking into consideration all such bases
                    accounting personnel can assess or determine the tax liability. In addition to this, in IAS 12 contains
                    rules regarding the measurement of deferred tax. Along with this, tax rate are also varied from one year
                    to another. In this, accounting personnel is required to update with changing rules and policies.
                    Through this, finance manager and accounting personnel would become able to determine suitable tax
                    liability. In addition to this, IAS 26 serves information about retirement plans which can be
                    distinguished into two types such as defined benefit and contribution plan. Hence, it clearly presents
                    information about the recording, measurement and disclosure of information regarding the retirement
                    benefit plans. Hence, for effective presentation accounting personnel must have knowledge regarding the
                    rules and regulations which are related to it (Bond, Govendir and Wells, 2016). Thus, by considering all
                    such aspects it can be said that technical and conceptual knowledge is highly required for dealing with
                    the standards more effectively and efficiently. Moreover, reporting and measurement aspect of pension
                    plan is highly differing from one standard to another (McPhail, Macdonald and Ferguson, 2016). For
                    instance: UK GAAP has different rules in relation to treatment on pension benefits in against to IAS.
                    Hence, conceptual understanding and knowledge is highly required for dealing with the amount of
                    retirement benefits and deferred tax amount. There are several key issues which are associated with
                    financial reporting enumerated below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reporting needs and requirements are mentioned in the regulations which business entity requires
                        following for ensuring transparency in the final accounts. However, sometimes is not possible for
                        the business organization to comply with all the rules to the large extent.
                    </li>
                    <li>Further, some government authorities have framed and introduced legislation which entail that
                        companies are not obliged to prepare financial statements according to accounting standards.
                        Moreover, sometimes treasurer directives also enforce accounting standard which company has to
                        follow for the preparation of financial statements. </li>
