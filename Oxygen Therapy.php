</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>In order to promote positive health status for Michelle Bell, it is essential for the registered nurse to provide suitable medication and treatment to the patient. In the present case, Michelle had breathlessness and nausea and she also had mild tachycardia (Watanabe and et.al., 2016).
                    </li>
                    <li>Hence, she feel unwell and most often her pulse reaches to 160bpm. She do not engage herself in exercise and she does not care about her diet as well.
                    </li>
                    <li>Therefore, looking towards this aspect, it is crucial for the registered nurse to develop a diet plan so that Michelle could consume healthy diet.
                    </li>
                    <li>At the same time, it is also recommended to her to stop drinking regularly because that is also affecting her heart condition (O’Driscoll and et.al., 2016).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Pathology And Pathophysiology Of The Health State Of The Patient
                </p>
                <p>As, Michelle Bell is having tachycardia, her heart beats too fast and it also do not pump blood effectively to rest of the body. This deprives the other organs and tissues of oxygen and as a result it causes shortness of breath. Pulse rate of Michelle is rapid due to tachycardia; hence because of all these factors, she has irregular heartbeat. When Michelle is admitted to the hospital, it was analysed that her BP is 165/90 mmHg (O’Flynn, McLaughlin and Keatings, 2016). This caused breathlessness to her and consequently she turned pale. Tachycardia is caused by something that disrupts the normal electrical impulse which controls the rate of heart’s pumping action. There are various things that contribute to this problem such as anaemia, exercise, high or low blood pressure, drinking too many caffeinated beverages and abuse of alcohol. Hence, it can be said that all these things have caused major changes in Michelle Bell’s health (Monro-Somerville and et.al., 2016).

                <h5>Strengths and weaknesses
</h5>
                <p>In the present case, I played the role of registered nurse in casualty department of the hospital and I made care plan for Michelle Bell. According to my job roles, I could say that I had played all my responsibilities in effective manner. I made certain changes in her diet so that she could take healthy food (Cronin and et.al., 2016). This is essential for her as most of the time she gets food from outside and as a result, she is having various health issues. However, I have faced several challenges as well due to Michelle’s regular drinking habit. Since, she drinks most days, so the medication did not show me that outcome which I expected.
                </p>
                <h5>Demonstrate commitment to professional learning and patient outcome
</h5>
                <p>In terms of improvement, I will adopt certain things so that I can manage my capability to contribute more efforts in enhancing my practice. I will make sure that I always prepare care plan on the basis of accessing the medical history of the patient. Further, all the professional standards will be maintained while delivering care services to the patients (Cronin and et.al., 2016). For future cases, I will ensure that I am considering all the aspects of the patients so that better and prominent services could be delivered.
