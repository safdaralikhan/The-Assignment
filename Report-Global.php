                </p>
                <h5>Question 1.
</h5>
                <p>Tesco is an international company in UK which provide retails goods to their customers. Tesco wants to
                    expand its market in the whole world for this purpose they make strategies for their business. For this
                    purpose they do SWOT analysis to find out their strength, weakness, opportunities and threats. The SWOT
                    analysis is described as below: Strength: Tesco is very popular in the UK economy and they also provide
                    satisfaction to their customers properly. They also use better marketing strategies for their products
                    and services. They are also very flexible and adopt the changes quickly. They provide goods to their
                    customers at reasonable prices and of best quality (Rothaermel 2015). They use new processes and
                    technologies to produce their products and services that also helps to earn them more profits in the
                    market and they can also take advantage from their competitors. They have also brand loyalty and they
                    also sell their products online to their customers. They also improve their technology according to the
                    needs. They are very familiar from the market of UK. Weakness: They also has weakness so they need to
                    overcome from these weaknesses. Their distribution channel of their products and services is not much
                    effective. So they need to improve their distribution channel to compete their competitors. Also some of
                    the goods are very expensive and cannot sold out too much so they can remove those products from the
                    market. They also struggle in the non-food sector but they are specialists in other sectors such as food
                    sectors, electrical products etc. Tesco is a company of public sector so that they need to spend much
                    money in the expansion of UK market(Peng 2013). They can overcome from their weakness by take
                    opportunities over them. They are very much depend on the small retailers to fulfil their resources.
                    They do not have proper human resource for their business. Opportunities: Tesco also has many
                    opportunities in the market that they can take from the market. They can also take investment from the
                    other countries that will help in their development. They also provide home delivery to their customers
                    so that it will help them to achieve the customers loyalty. Tesco also sell their products online that
                    is food and non-food products. They continuously increase their sales so that it will help them to
                    achieve the more profits. They also have opportunity to enter in various market so that it will help
                    them in development and growth. Threat: They have threat from their competitors who produce same type of
                    products and also provide goods and services to the people of the country. If they rise in their price
                    of their products then it may lead the lower profits of the company. Every people of the country always
                    attracts towards the new products which are of best quality. So if Tesco want to overcome fro their
                    threats then they need to make strong position in the market. They also need to provide products and
                    services of best quality to their customers at a reasonable prices. Local consumers are very well
                    familiar from the products and services of the Tesco company. If Tesco take their threats as an
                    adventure then it will help to overcome. The supply power of their product is very low so that they
                    cannot fulfil the demand of their customers timely so competitors can take advantage of this
                    (Cornelissen 2014). It is essential for a business organization is that to use various aspects in order
                    to achieve organizational goals and objectives in an effective manner. For this the firm is required to
                    use a strategic choice which h can help to implement their activities to deliver their vision. A
                    strategic portfolio management is a systematic process which helps to deciding organizational resources
                    to meet their strategic objectives in an effective manner. In the context of Marks and Spenser which is
                    one of the leading company required that to use various tools and techniques in order to attain their
                    desired goals and objectives. According to the annual report of the cited business organization they
                    focused on the various aspects which can help to improve their business performance. for example, retail
                    industry is one of the competitive sector in the United Kingdom. So that the profitability and market
                    share are going down which needs to be focused in an effective manner. The higher authorities required
                    that to expand their business which can help to maintain their profitability in an effective manner.</p>
                <h5>Question 2.Retail internationalisation: Strategic alliances, M&As
</h5
>

                    profits and develop their business to that’s called strategies alliances. In which two or mare parties
                    working together to earn profits and there are all partners are mutually working with each other’s and
                    divide profits and losses with each other. In which mutually divide fund, capital, resources etc. by the
                    partners (Brondoni 2012). In the other hand, strategies alliances are create when two or more parties
                    want to work together to earn mutual benefits and profits by the business. Strategies alliances are
                    legal but it is less than joint venture because there are two or more parties are work together not for
                    permanent in the future they are working for earn profits and benefits. Merger and acquisition(M&A) in
                    which two or more companies financially to purchase their company and start a new company with new name
                    and with new objectives and goals. Merger in which mainly two or more companies are merge together for
                    start a new company with new and innovative ideas views those help to build a brand image in the market
                    and help to achieve decided targets and goals of the business. In which all parties are working together
                    for mutual benefits but they are start a new company with new name. To the merger have to made a legal
                    agreement under the legal law and act of this department and should take permission to the government.
                    On the other hand, acquisition is one company take over on the other company and continuously working in
                    that company by the acquire person. M&A is the most powerful aspects in the financially corporate world
                    in which two or more companies are working together to their mutual benefits and start anew business.
                    All these aspects of main aims and objectives are wealth maximization, earn higher profits, build a
                    market image and provide better and effective innovative product and services to customers (Ameer and
                    Othman 2012). Through these financially aspects increase economic scale of the country, diversification
                    growth of the products and services and also diversify risk and chance of loss in the business. All
                    these are help to increase market share of the business and change the techniques and strategies to
                    produce effective products and services. In the other hand, all these are help to develop business in
                    the systematic a manner and help to build a market image to use new and innovative techniques and
                    strategies to produce product services to their customers. Merger and acquisition in all terms are legal
                    in the country because in which two or more companies are come together legally and made a legal
                    agreement. So there are follow some rules and regulations those are regulated by government of country.
                    If in case there are not legal agreement so all illegal according to the government. Tesco is the retail
                    chain that want to start business with M&S. This company provide all type of products and services to
                    customers and already build a effective image in the market and also in the customers mind. These both
                    are retail companies in the UK market (Torres,2012). These want to develop their business and increase
                    market share of the company so according to this situation merger and acquisition is the best solution
                    to both company. In which both are start are new company with new name. In this aspect of finance
                    develop a new company to build a new innovative image in the market and increase market share and also
                    increase economic share of the country. Mergers and acquisition having some advantages and disadvantages
                    to the develop a new business with new and innovative ideas. There are some advantages those are help to
                    develop business like: when two or more companies are merge together so those companies of power and
                    control are mutually merge and help to develop market share of the company. Through the merger and
                    acquisition diversify risk of the business. Its help to increase economic scale of the business (Zott
                    and Amit, 2010). In addition, it also develop technology departments to produce new and innovative
                    products to the customers. Merger and acquisition of main benefit is tax benefits in this aspect of
                    finance tax saving method to merger companies and start a new company with new name. In the other hand,
                    there are some disadvantages those are harmful for both parties like: mergers and acquisition method in
                    loss experience with both parties and have to share all knowledge and techniques with each other so
                    there are loss experience of the parties. In this method company will facing many difficulties and
                    issues to start a new company also there are increase cost to develop business and their productions and
                    there are using some new and innovative techniques in which have to invest money to develop business and
                    achieve objectives and goals (Milne and Gray 2013.). In the other hand, merger and acquisition is the
                    financial aspects in which Tesco and M&S to develop their business so that will merge and acquisition
                    method will apply to develop business.</p>
