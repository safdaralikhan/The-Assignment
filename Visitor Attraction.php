<h5>2.3 Effect of different theories of tourist motivation on the management of visitor attractions</h5>

<br>
<p>It is on the basis of a conceptual fact in whose accordance, motivation defines the realistic needs and demands of the tourists that are required to be fulfilled in an effective manner. It is where these requirements in turn drives the people to act in a considerate manner by duly satisfying them. However, this procedure keeps on changing as per the primary consideration of the users with some more intensified actions to move onto the next steps (Dewhurst and Thwaites, 2014). Herein, motivation is usually rewarded in between behavior and satisfaction where the behavior will result in satisfied customers with fulfilled needs and demands. Also, the reward will tend to motivate the people to attempt similar activities again. It is therefore in context to the tact of tourism, the visitors are referred to travel only in case there preferences are being exchanged by the motivational procedure as depicted below- It is thus with a correspondent outlook towards it, below are some motivational theories that links to this fact where a person will travel only his or her mental perception will be fulfilled in an efficient manner. These theories are as delineated below-</p>
<br>
<li>Maslow’s need hierarchy theory- It is basically a hierarchical representation of people’s need that are arranged in an orderly manner where the fulfillment of the lower requisition will move to the upper one and so on (Goeldner and Ritchie, 2012).

</li>
<li>Alderfer’s ERG theory- It is based upon three communal constituents of existence, relatedness and growth where it is analogous to the above defined theory of Maslow’s need hierarchy. The only dissimilarity among both these theories are their sectioned needs where the five hierarchical needs of Maslow is hereby covered under only three.</li>
<li>Herzberg two factor theory- It is a fascinating conceptual theory of Herzberg based upon two vital factors namely health factor and motivators where in concord to his belief, it has been said that the opposite term of motivation is no motivation instead of de-motivation. It is together based upon yet another conspicuous fact where the absence of health factor leads to de-motivate the tourists with no such effect on being present (Järvensivu, Lukkari and Järvensivu, 2010). However, the motivators duly increases the encouragement level of the tourists with no such impact on being absent.</li>
<br>
<p>TASK 3</p>
<br>
<h5>3.1 Different visitor management strategies</h5>
<br>
<p>There exists many such industries that are duly involved in the process of sales and marketing as a way of trading their offered commodities. The industry of visitor’s attraction is one such industry that is more dependent as compared to others in terms of their customer’s experiences (Lawton and Weaver, 2015). It is hereby largely associated with a need base dimension of customer service required to be implemented in the sector of travel and tourism. For which, the tour planners are duly imposed to create some significant opportunities by experiencing a very specific agenda of targeting based on some special anticipations and demands of a segmented market. It should be however done with a strong understanding of the targeted set of market. Wherein, tourist’s experience can be distributed in four distinct phases-</p>
<br>

It is therefore after anticipating about the vacation, the visitors began to investigate the areas they can refer to visit by collecting some likely information for it. In this sequel, they hereby start fantasizing those areas that they may travel.</li>
<li>Choosing a destination for it- It is in continuation of the above discovered tact of a visitor, this refers to yet another prime requisition of selecting a pertinent destination that is often influenced by several number of factors. These are cost, ambiance, packaging, and other affiliated constituents (Losada and et.al., 2016).</li>
<li>Taking a journey- It is after a successful wind-up of the above two components, this reflects the third phase in which the travellers will hereby refer for a final trip in which, they might experience variety of sensations. This usually involves satisfaction, feelings, dissatisfaction and transmutation, etc.</li>
<li>Reviewing the journey- It is the last stage in which the views of post trip will be hereby analysed by the travellers where they will together refer to share their experiences with their friends, relatives and peers, etc. Herein, they may either recommend them to visit the area they have travelled as of now or may themselves refer to visit it again (Moutinho, 2011).</li>
<br>
<p>Based upon the above four vital phases of a tourist’s experiences, it is thereby recommended to the administrative bodies of National Tourism Agency VisitBritain to follow some effective tactics to maximize the visitor’s attraction in a strategic way-</p>
<br>
<p>Research- It is a foremost step that is further divided into three definite proportions with a foremost consideration of establishing the core values of a destination on the basis of visitor’s experience (Pearce and Wu, 2016). This will be based upon the four leading features that includes durability, relevance along with a communicative and spectacular depiction. After which, the management is required to survey the contemporary preferences of the visitors by together making a comparison between the present image of the destination with that to the contenders.</p>
<br>
<p>Identification of personality and positioning- This is firstly to represent the nation with a precise delineation of its attributional traits such as its people and their culture with the landscape and adventure. Wherein, these identified measures will in turn provide a prosperous opportunity of getting converted into brand personality. Such vital generation will in turn assists the concerned bodies to make an emotional relationship with the targeted set of market. It is where crafting of brand will symbolize the identity of the destination based upon its cultural values that resultantly encourages the tour related organisations to considerably communicate those to their associated clients and users. This particular step is together composed of yet another preposition of positioning where it needs a tag line to symbolize the oriented brand to interact with external audiences as well. It is in case of large destination, multiple tag lines can be used for multiple segments.</p>
<br>
<p>Enforcing the brand- It is yet another principle requirement in which distinct channels are being used to communicate the positioned brand to the targeted number of users (Stark, 2015). This usually involves the tact of advertising via various interactive tools of media like internet, etc., or done by arranging public relation events and applying the procedures of direct marketing, etc. It is with a fundamental consideration of the management to market the brand via media and events to create awareness among the targeted set of users.</p>

<br>
<p>Long term maintenance of brand- This is basically referred to a long term tact of marketing as a way of retaining the brand personality. Although, the stipulated values are constantly refined and adapted by carrying out regular exploration of recent market trends so as to make a consistent position in the market with the help of long term planning.</p>

<br>
<h5>3.2 Management techniques in relation to sustainability</h5>
<br>
<p>This is with a chief consideration of assuring a sustainable impact of tourism on tour destinations and the local community that will get affected. In regard to which, it is important to realize the chain of supply and demand in the market of tourism. Beside this, a principal interpretation of tourism among the community members is together an essential outlook where the residents are the first to sense the effect of tourism in the nation (Wang, Li, Zhen and Zhang, 2016). It is where they are hereby represented as an important stakeholder of this industrial sector whose standpoints are referred to play an important role in defining the sustainability of tourism in a nation. It is in evidence to a fact where a measured tourism leads to enhance the wealthiness of a country like UK by together assisting the preservation of earth’s natural and cultural resources. Whereas, the local people may suffer from the invasion of tourists whose extent can be measured by conducting a resident survey. This will in turn provide a base line info regarding the mental attitude of the occupants that can then be in turn used with the intent of observing and managing the information in affiliated to the development of tourism in UK (Dewhurst and Thwaites, 2014). There exists several such parameters that can be measured through the resident survey and can also serve as reg flags to analyze those potent factors that could estrange the assailable population due to tourism related activities. Also, the study results can be used to ensure the fulfillment of certain developmental agendas from tourism by assuring improvement in social, economic and environmental issues that are related to tourism. This data can together be used to edify the assemblage about both risks and benefits related to tourism where they can also get proud of their inheritance.</p>
