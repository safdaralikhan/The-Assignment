        <h5>7. ETHICAL EVALUATION OF ACCOUNTING SYSTEM</h5>   
        <p>7.1 Accounting system against ethical principles</p> 

                <p>Ethics are most essential part of business operations, it is all about doing the right think in order to run the business in ethical manner. It is the principle of accounting that to be fair and honest. It is necessary for the entity that to follow all instruction in effective manner and never breach any law. It is essential principle of accounting system is that to maintain confidentiality and integrity in the organization. It is necessary for A to Z Vehicle Hire company that to care the data properly.
                </p>

                <h5>7.2 Actual breaches of professional ethics in the organization</h5>

                <p>7.2.1 One of the main ethical principles is that to have professional competence and due care. But staff members of A to Z Vehicle Hire company was not having sufficient knowledge about accounting software and they are not aware with tax policies as well. It is the duty of company is that to maintain professional knowledge and increase level of skills of its workers those who are working in the accounting department. But employees of cited firm were not having knowledge and experience of accounting software and current standards. That is breach of ethical principle which is not acceptable in the organizations. 7.2.2 Confidentiality is the major ethical principal which is necessary to maintain by the corporation. In A to Z Vehicle Hire company employees were misusing the internet which was illegal and unethical. Access of unauthorized website is not ethical and it is consider as breach of law under the accounting system. There is risk that people can pass the confidential detail of the company to others which can create trouble for the organization.

                </p>

                <h5>7.3 Recommendation</h5>
              
                <p>7.3.1 To resolve the professional ethical issues, organization needs to hire all those persons which are highly qualified and skilled so that they can easily understand the software system easily.

Company should try to organize learning programs through lectures, case study. 7.3.3 These activities help to build an effective relationship with the professional in an organization. Organization also set up code of ethics and violating the code so that all the issue is reported to the head of the department. Firm also need to prepare appropriate documentation which consists of the nature of the work and also help to reduce the risk/ liability for the organization. Professionals also examine the workers and educate them by certification process and professional learning as per the per-determined code of ethic (Bebbington, Unerman and O’Dwyer, 2014). Hence, by using the ethical code of conducts all the professionals’ ethic issues can be solved effectively in an organization.</p>
                <p>8. SUSTAINABILITY EVALUATION OF THE ACCOUNTING SYSTEM</p>

             <h5>8.1 Payroll problems:</h5>
                <p>8.1.1 Payroll issues cause dis-satisfaction among the employee and organisation if salary is not paid on time. Employees become frustrated when they don’t get payment. Payments are made in terms of business working days, can be made in duration like bi-weekly, twice-monthly or monthly. If these are made on time will affect the performance of employee and they will work effectively and efficiently (Evans, 2013). There are some reason which causes problems like using the incorrect deduction amounts, not classify the employees correctly, and overtime rules, no changes and no increment in payroll. 8.1.2 Organisation must increase the wages of employee timely which enhance their morale. There should no overtime rules and if employee is working overtime, they should be paid extra wages (Taylor and Curtis, 2010). Employee’s classification can be done properly to identify the work or each person and provide wages according to task or job.
                </p>
               <h5>8.2 Process of salary and wages:</h5>
            
                <p>8.2.1 Paying wages to employee’s, have large process that starts which the standard work assign to them, analysing the performance, monitoring the work and finding out quality of work done by employee’s. 8.2.2 This task is not performed by individual person. One person is required to analysis the skills and ability of each employee and then assign the standard performance, one person is required to monitor the actual performance of employee and one person is required to compensate according to work done by employee (Burritt and Schaltegger, 2010). Organisation must hire number of person for processing the salary and wages to the employee’s.
                </p>
                <h5>8.3 Management of accounts:</h5>

                <p>8.3.1 There are many problems arises in managing the accounts such as adaptability that the accounts are made according to standard and guidelines, the process and techniques are not adopted by the every organisation but can be done by specific companies. Some venture finds difficulty in implementation of the standard format of accounting, they don’t find flexible as they want to change according to the environment. 8.3.2 Other issue is reliability, top level of management have to be dependent upon the accounting to make decision such as top level want to determine the sales of next year, the company need to wait for the figures of next year, can’t able to determine by the past and present data. Maintaining the standard of accounting have huge cost, proper auditing should be done and if any incorrect data arises, it will spoil the decision making process of top level of management. While collection of all the data from internal and external source, 8.3.3 Organisation need to invest upon that, it requires proper design, implement, monitor and evaluate. For resolving this problem, venture need to maintain the proper records of their translation so that gathering of information does not include huge time and cost and timely analysis is done so that market trends helps to analysis the sales of coming year (Zimmerman and Yahya-Zadeh, 2011). The company should not totally rely on the financial data to take decision, he can take help from other departments such as production one to find out the inventory level and minimum and maximum stock level, sales one to find out the needs and wants of the consumer, research and development one to get innovative techniques for increase in sales and profitability and marketing one to attack large number of customer’s (Zadek, Evans and Pruzan, 2013).</p>

             
                   <h5>9. INTERNAL CONTROL AND FRAUD EVALUATION</h5>
                   <p>9.1 Internal control</p>
                   <p>In order to restrict the undesirable practices of A to Z is required to lay high level of emphasis on the aspect of internal control. Hence, by making assessment of accounts or records in against to voucher firm can get information about the level of employee’s dishonesty as well as errors and omission to a great extent.
