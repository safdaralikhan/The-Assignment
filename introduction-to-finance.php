                <p>QUESTION 1
                </p>
                <p>a. Various corporate governance codes which may prevent corporate scandals and collapses
                </p>
                <p>Corporate governance: It can be defined as the collection of different types of rules, regulation and
                    principles that are imposed by legal authority of a country for all the business entities that are
                    executing business in a country. For all the companies it is very important to comply with them in order
                    to ignore corporate scandals and collapses. Some of its codes are as follows: Organisation for economic
                    cooperation and development principles: It states that all the business entities or corporations are
                    required to follow specific guidelines that are made for financial reporting and auditing. With the help
                    of it possibility of corporate scandals can be reduced because it can help to keep track record of
                    operations which will be beneficial for business activities (Frino, Hill and Chen, 2015). It adds
                    different features to the final accounts such as transparency, full disclosure etc. Stock exchange
                    listing standards: According to this code of corporate governance it is very important for a company who
                    is offering shares to public to list itself on a registered stock exchange. With the help of it
                    corporate collapses could be reduced because it will help to decrease the possibility ot governmental
                    interference in business operations.

                <p>b. Advantages for an organisation of registering as a sole trader
                </p>
                <p>If an organisation register itself as a sole trader then there are various benefits for it to that
                    enterprise. All the advantages of it are as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If a company is registered as a sole trader then the owner will be the only boss and power of
                        decision making is not required to be shared with other partners of people within the organisation.
    
                    </li>
                    <li>In sole traders owner keeps all the profits so if an organisation is registered as a sole trader
                        then all the profits could be kept by single person who is the owner of business.
                    </li>
                    <li>A sole trader business could be established easily due to lack of limitations of recording,
                        reporting and legal structures (Gitman, Juchau and Flanagan, 2015). And the organisations structure
                        is also not required to be followed in this type of business as a single person executes all the
                        business activities.
                    </li>
                    <li>If an organisation gets registered as a sole trader then there is one main benefit of it to the
                        company is that there is no legal implication regarding sharing information with public regarding
                        business activities.
                    </li>
                    <li>The business structure of a sole trader could be changed easily because if the owner plans to expand
                        business in future then it could be done easily.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>1-Since there is no information provided regarding the units of opening stock or closing stock, it has
                    been assumed that the £5 per unit is related to materials utilized in production of such output. A
                    production budget is one which is a comprehensive statement which details out a complete break-down of
                    given information in the form of units of products manufactured by a particular organisation (Melicher
                    and Norton, 2013). Utilizing this information, it has been ascertained that the total per unit
                    production cost for the budgeted output is £72.075 which in monetary terms amounts to £2883000. Thus,
                    one can say that the total unit cost incurred by Z Ltd. in the production of 40,000 unit for the next
                    period is £72.075 per unit.

                    up the unit costs by 45%. Hence, the expenses worth £3723600 is ascertained as 35% of the total labour
                    cost, that is, £2871000 (=£2088000+£783000). On the other hand, the Fixed Costs worth £0.3625 per unit
                    is ascertained by marking up the unit fixed costs by 45%. Through this process, the targeted selling
                    price per unit for the 40,000 units of output produced is £104.51.

                <p>As per the information given in previous table, the above Cash Budget has been prepared. In order to
                    ensure simplicity of calculations, it is assumed that the month initiates on the first of January.
                    Another assumption that has been taken while preparing this budget is that the Finished Units purchased
                    by Z Ltd. from its suppliers are 40,000 at £72.075 per unit on a monthly basis. Keeping this in mind,
                    the payments made for the purchases have been shown for each purchase between the periods January and
                    April. For instance, the 60% of the unit price paid to the supplier for January Purchase is allocated to
                    February. On the other hand, the purchase of finished units made in February and other consecutive
                    months have their 60% share payment allocated to March and other consecutive months.

                <p>d. Disadvantages of using Zero-based Budgeting System:
                </p>
                <p>In the context of given case scenario, Z Ltd. has been utilizing various budgetary information in order
                    to control costs of production while maximising profit. Keeping this mind, various drawbacks of using
                    Zero-based Budgeting System have been advised to its management which have been discussed as under:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Time Consuming as it includes initiating of planning of all functional costs from scratch at the
                        beginning of each financial period (Ross, Westerfield and Jaffe, 2013).
                    </li>
                    <li>Since it includes complete refurbishing of functional costs, higher number of manpower is required
                        to formulate the ideal Zero-based Budget for the company.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Thus, adoption of this system would result in incurring of excessive costs for Z Ltd. as well as
                    expertise to explain the inclusion or exclusion of cost related to each task.

                </p>
                <p>Cost volume profit analysis: It can be defined as a technique which is used by business entities to
                    determine their contribution which is remaining after deducting all variable expenses from sales or
                    revenues. The contribution is firstly used to recover all the fixed costs and then the remaining amount
                    is considered as profits for the organisation (Schwienbacher and Larralde, 2012). Main objective of
                    using it is to determine relationship between profit, volume and cost of specific business units. With
                    the help of it ability of an organisation to generate profits could be measured. In other words it could
                    be defined as a planning process which is used by managers for the purpose of forecasting future volume
                    of production, sales, costs and profits which could be acquired in future. There are various strengths
                    and weaknesses of this technique which are as follows: <b>Strengths:</b>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cost volume profit analysis help top level executives to formulate strategic decisions for future by
                        helping them to determine value of actual expenses and incomes which has taken places for a specific
                        time period. With the help of it they will be able to make strategies in which they can plan to
                        enhance overall profitability of organisation.
                    </li>
                    <li>With the help of cost volume profit analysis detailed information of organisation’s activities could
                        be gathered. It can guide managers to forecast future sales, profits and losses which may take place
                        in upcoming period of time.
                    </li>
                    <li>It helps to find break even point for the organisation so that it can be determined that when amount
                        of units are required to be manufactured in order to cover all the expenses and investments that are
                        made in business.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is considered as the base of plans that are made for various purposes such as marketing,
                        budgeting etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>As it guides managers to forecast future sales and revenues so it can also help them to make budget
                        according to requirements of organisation.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Cost volume analysis can result in different human errors because for managers it is not
                            possible to record information in a precise way and if detailed data is recorded in books then
                            it can result in human errors (Shoup, 2017).
                        </li>
                        <li>As it is based upon projection and future is uncertain so it is not possible to trust the
                            projections to make appropriate business decisions.

                            it could not be the only driver to forecast the same.

                <p>b. Key Differences between discounted and non-discounted methods of investment appraisal
                </p>
                <p>For any organisation, investment appraisal methods play an important role as they help in measuring the
                    feasibility and viability of a project that is considered as a potential opportunity for the enterprise.
                    Due to this reason, a company may apply various discounted and non-discounted methods of investment
                    appraisal. Discounted techniques of investment appraisal are those which ascertain Future Cash flows by
                    discounting them using a certain figure, usually Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) to determine
                    their present day values. These include calculation of NPV, IRR of the projects (Yescombe, 2013). On the
                    other hand, the Non-Discounted methods of investment appraisal are ones which derive cash flows on their
                    current values. Mostly these include determination of Payback period as well as Accounting Rate of
                    Return. Thus, the key difference between the two is the utilization of discounting factor to derive
                    present value of the given future cash flow figures.

                <h5>Conclusion
                </h5>
                <p>From the above project report it has been concluded that finance is an element which is required by all the business entities to conduct operational as well as executional activities. With the help of it long as well as short term goals could be achieved by utilising monetary resources appropriately. If an organisation is not able to manage funds properly then it can leave negative impacts on operational efficiency. There are various techniques which could be used to determine actual status of the company these are cost volume analysis, investment appraisal techniques etc. Companies can also formulate budgets such as production so that actual cost of business activities could be analysed.
