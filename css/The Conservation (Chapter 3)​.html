            <h3>Report on Role Of The Precautionary Principle In The Conservation (Chapter 2)
            </h3>
            <p>The Application Of The Precautionary Principle In The Conservation And Sustainable Use Of Marine
                Biodiversity
            </p>
            <p>Fishery management
            </p>
            <p>There exists a direct relationship among sustainable development of fisheries and he concerned
                precautionary management. It was agreed by the 94th Session of FAO Council in 1988, that sustainable
                development is the management as well as conservation of the natural resource base. This has also led to
                the positioning of technological as well as institutional changes in a specific manner which ensures
                attaining and continuing satisfaction of demands of humans in relation to present and future
                generations. The strategies are also required to attain sustainability of high degree in the use of
                natural renewable resources by the humans, moreover which are not even easy to believe and utilize.
                There is also an increased demand for improving the conventional fishery management and that needs to be
                attached to an increasing concern for enhancing the management of environmental issues. This has been
                developed in consequence to of World Conference on Human Environment and Fishery Development and
                Management. It also states that the present condition of fisheries is because of poorly controlled
                management by the concerned authorities. Thus, it is also identified that in natural ecosystem, the
                abundance of preys and predators and their variations are controlled and maintained within the
                compatible limits of ecosystem sustainability. Thus, in this respect it can be said that the concept of
                precautionary principle aims to improve preservation of environment and the available resources through
                reduction in risk of damaging them. Further, it also promotion and achieving an equitable balance within
                short duration is also intended, regarding present environmental degradation and overfishing Thus, it
                can be said that this can be referred for public actions as well as policies and this also includes two
                core principle such as it strengthens the need of environmental protection which further also intents to
                encourage hindrance in proportion to the potential risks. However, the other one is concerned about the
                obliteration of risks. Henceforth, it is clear that the application of this principle within the fishing
                sector came into existence in response to the view of the condition in relation to resources and lack of
                effectivity which warrant the sustainability of the exploitations.</p>
            <p>Tropical reefs
            </p>
            <p>Coral reefs can be characterized as biologically rich ecosystem on earth which helps in providing foods,
                job opportunities, money and security to many people across the globe. However, proper actions are
                required to be taken else coral reefs and the magnificent creatures could arise danger at the time when
                it appears. They could threatened through an accretive range of influences in the form of pollution,
                diseases and it could also alter global climate. At the same time, it is also observed that the rapid
                involvement of these aspects could decline the loss of ancient valuable ecosystem which have significant
                social, economic and environment consequences all over the world. For instance President of the US
                enforced the Coral Reef Task Force in 1998 with the intention of protecting and conserving coral reefs.
                The CRTF is under obligation to undertake tasks of mapping and monitoring the coral reefs of US, which
                further assists in research in relation to causes of coral reef degradation. This also includes
                pollution and over fishing and besides this, it also finds solutions to these problems. Further, it also
                promotes conservation to suitable use of coral reefs. NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric
                Administration) acts as the principle member of CRTF; thus it has the responsibility to conserve coral
                reef ecosystems. All the attempts are being carried out through the Coral reef Conservation Program
                which operates with scientific, government and non-governmental organization to achieve the goals of the
                CRTF. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also uses high resolution satellite imagery and
                Global Positioning Satellite technologies which has helped in making digital maps of reefs in Puerto
                Rico. It also uses satellite technology so as to detect harmful algal blooms which has the capability to
                smother reefs and apart from this, it also works in monitoring elevated sea surface temperature which
                further can cause coral bleaching. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration works as a protective
                measure through which biodiversity can be managed and sustained. It also aids in monitoring reefs using
                the Coral Reefs Early Warning System which consists of buoys that is deployed at reef sites that
                measures air temperature, wind speed and direction, barometric pressure, sea temperature and tide
                levels. However, in addition to the above monitoring process, it also assist in conducting research,
                assessment and restoration projects of coral reefs in marine reserves and among deep- sea coral blanks.
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, it is also ascertained that National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration works to remove
                tons of marine debris from the North-western Hawaiian Islands and restore damaged reefs. As per the
                discussion, it can be said that monitoring, research as well as restorations are imperative in terms of
                safeguarding coral reefs. However, for ultimate protection, legal mechanisms are also required to be
                followed. In terms of legal aspects, it involves the establishment of marine protected areas because it
                have added force of law (protected marine enclosure). This is a major part of coral reef system which
                could also enhance the chances of survival of ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>Marine reserves
            </p>
            <p>Marine protected areas adverts the regions in which activities undertaken by humans cause reduction in
                population in a direct or indirect manner through habitat alteration. This eliminates risks on greater
                extent. This spatial explicit approach aids in managing influences of humans that has many potential
                ecological and socio-economic benefits. This can increase problems that are vital to accepted management
                practices; hence it could benefit the conventional practices. Precautionary principles have been
                developed for the purpose of conservation and management as it includes patterns in relation to
                haphazard design, execution, enforcement and judgment. This often produces equivocal and contradict
                evidence for both ecological and evaluation aspects. For instance – absence of full scientific certainty
                about marine species are threatened with extinction and this is also at greater risk which is related to
                marine ecosystem. In this respect, the ruling bodies have established creation of marine protected areas
                which is one of the instruments that works to safeguard the integrity of ecosystem and of marine
                biodiversity. While, on the other hand it also aids to protect and restore threatened marine species
                through the application of precautionary principle. This also works as a management strategy which
                protects the value of marine life. Complementing an ecosystem’s protection through precautionary
                principle could threatened species which are also protected by numerous other strategies. Apparently,
                threatened species covers three categories for extinct and threatened species wherein marine species are
                at greater risk. Application of Precautionary principle in this area of concern as a process to
                implement MPAs and this also protects threatened species that assesses the risks that are implicit in
                managing those areas and species. This also involves analysing several factors which creates and manages
                other areas. It also creates emphasizes on several conventional management practices; thus it could
                supplant other practices. There are many challenges for the managers to be followed along with
                conservation scientists and economists. One of the major challenges that manager faces is to foster
                agreement among the stakeholders regarding the proposed system of MPA. This has also prepared national
                action plans for species conservation and recovery. Along with this, specific policies are also being
                formulated to protect and recover species and the licensing of potentially or effectively pollution
                activities. Therefore, it can be said that precautionary principle application to biodiversity
                conservation and marine natural resources acts as one of the fundamental tools in direction of
                sustainable development. This also provides guidance for governance and management at the time of
                responding to risks and uncertainties. Thus, it can be said that along with federal government and high
                courts, such regulation have been developed under precautionary principle for conserving marine
                reserves. Relying on the accepting nature of this population and communities of coastal marine species,
                dispersal of reproductive propagules is vital to implement under marine protection which also assist in
                enhancing the value of ecosystem. Apart from this, there are many species that have limited dispersal
                potential. Thus, it is clear that many species have restricted potential to disperse which also states
                that local population of species with great dispersion can be to some extent self- replenishing.</p>
            <h4>Marine coastal protected areas
            </h4>
            <p>From general point of view, marine protected areas are known for those areas wherein protective and
                restorative precautionary measures have been instituted so as to protect and conserve species that exist
                in the ecosystem, habitats, ecosystems and ecological procedure of the marine environment. In this
                context, OSPAR Ministers have agreed upon this so as encourage the development of a network that
                protects marine areas and this also follows a time scale which leads to preparatory work. This is
                typically established so as to develop an ecologically coherent network of MPAs in the North-East
                Atlantic which is also appropriately managed by OSPAR network. This has been established for the purpose
                of protecting, conserving and restoring species, habitats and ecological processes which can experience
                issues related to human activities. This also aids in preventing degradation and harm of types of
                species, habits and ecological processes through considering precautionary principle. This also protects
                and conserves areas that represents various habitats that present in the environment especially in the
                maritime areas. The progress has been made by Constricting Parties which also identifies, selects and
                establishes MPAs as major mechanisms of the OSPAR network. This has been included in the latest progress
                report on the network which also includes a framework that describes the network. There are several
                legislation developed by the governmental bodies which also aims to follow Precautionary Principle and
                this is usually observed in the global legal framework in the mid-1980s. It also states that the
                principle is useful in providing directions about the execution of international studies where there
                also exist a scientific uncertainty. At the same time, it is also reflected in the Principle 15 of the
                Rio Declaration which at the same time also represents several threats that can even pose harmful
                impacts on the environment. Thus, this can be used as a factor that postpones the effective measures
                which are vital in terms of safeguarding the environment from several harmful facets. The standards are
                also useful in suggesting that proper actions needs to be taken in scientific evidence so that it could
                significantly protect environmental damage. In this domain, the precautionary approach has been applied
                as this relies on the relation which includes the prospective ways that aids in protecting the
                environment from different aspects. Thus, it also states that prior implementing any plans, proof of
                harmful effects should be considered. This also established the fact precautionary principle are usually
                adopted for the purpose of enhancing the economic prospects. Further, it could also be said that for the
                purpose of achieving sustainable development, there must be suitable regulation of policies that
                emphasizes on regulation of precautionary principle; however at the same time environmental measures
                must also be adopted in the same realm so that hazardous activities can be safeguarded in the best
                possible manner. In this line, OSPAR Convention also shows a direct link between safeguarding and
                precaution. Thus, it is clear that preventive measures are required to be adopted so that environment
                can be protected from diverse grounds. This exists even at the time where there do not have any sort of
                aspect concerned with causal relationship among inputs and the impacts. This also needs to be executed
                by the 1992 Baltic Sea Convention that establishes diverse variables and which also requires preventive
                measures. This also includes a reason which assumes that it might harm and cause the environment.
                Nevertheless, there is also a need to set criteria which identifies threshold that includes scientific
                evidence that exists regarding environmental challenge, seriousness of the impacts of such factors. It
                also has an integration with The Fish Stocks Agreement that is required to be applied under
                precautionary approach to fishing and to safeguard of association ecosystems and species. In this
                context, it could be said that a precautionary approach to fishing should be implicitly applied which
                entails to set out the details mentioned under Agreement 1995.</p>
            <h4>National sanctuaries
            </h4>
            <p>Environment protection and national sanctuaries is essential to be protected and to do so, the government
                has established several acts and legal requirements which also provides protection for enhancing the
                quality of the environment. At the same time, Government has introduced the Protection of the
                Environment Administration Act 1991 have been developed for the purpose of enhancing the aspects of
                sustainable development which is an important aspect of the eco-system. In this context, it can be said
                that the precautionary principle is essential since it assist in the accomplishing development in the
                environmental facets. It is also ascertained that if threats are present which can damage the
                environment, then it can affect the entire environmental values. This also depicts that there is exists
                a scientific certainty which plays crucial role on adopting new measures to safeguard the degradation of
                environmental aspects. Although, EPA is in practice and it is also concerned primarily with challenges
                that are associated with pollution in disposing of water. Therefore, it does not have broad powers to
                involve in the regulatory policy that is being perused by other organizations and agencies in
                environmental contexts. It is also mentioned in the Protection of the Environment Administration Act,
                that organizations can provide specific directions to public bodies and private councils (that work in
                this sphere) so that they can perform several actions as per the powers they have. This will also aid in
                contributing in protecting the environment and at the same time it can also diminish all such activities
                that can hamper the value of environmental facets. Therefore, it is also analysed that environment
                protection includes activities related to protection, restoring and maintaining ecological sustainable
                development. This also gives the information about EPA which needs some bargaining power and negotiation
                as well with those resources and environmental agencies with which it could become more involved.
                Talking about the practices, it can be said that although the EPA has become increasingly active in the
                field of biodiversity conservation by its engagement in protecting in stream flows and licensing, it has
                so far shown no state of inclination to become involved in issues of biodiversity conservation on
                privately owned land. For instance- in Leatch v National Parks and Wildlife service 81 LGERA 270 Stein J
                made it clear that failure to incorporate the principle specifically into legislation was not the end of
                the matter. In this case, precautionary principle under legislation was not applied according to
                principles that are essential in ecological sustainable development, however it was flexible enough to
                accommodate with it. The case has also involved a third party appeal for the purpose of granting
                licensing so that endangered species can be restricted which usually destroys the habitat present in the
                eco-system. The precautionary principle seems to provide framework regarding legal management that
                considers the impact of uncertainty. It is also responsible in providing guidance about the actions that
                can pose serious risks to the environment or health aspects of the human. This depicts that there is
                lack of scientific certainty which usually denotes harm. At the same time, the principle also showcases
                a formalized procedure that delays action in until harm becomes certain and at the same time, it will
                often means delaying. In this context, it can be said that precautionary becomes accurate at the time
                when threats are present to the environment and where specific policy formation are not there while
                changing the environment facets. However, on the other hand a few formulations provide more guidance
                which also comprises of several aspects that changes the value of precautionary. Along with this,
                science based risk assessment can also be considered as vital because it is an important aspect that is
                used in the area of precaution. The requirement of precaution develops at the time when there exist
                several threats that can impact the environment; however, it is also observed that this aspect of
                precautionary principle does not hold that much importance. It is also confined to irreparable damage,
                wherein there exist no provision for protection and it just specifies the requisite that lacks
                scientific certainty. Therefore, this should not be considered as a dimension that brings obligations
                which are also cost effective in nature.</p>
            <p>Marine Parks
            </p>
            <p>The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 is useful in providing for the
                proclamation and management of commonwealth reserves. This further also proclaims under the EPBC Act
                which include commonwealth terrestrial reserves such as national parks, botanic reserves and nature
                reserves. Statutory rights are also defined as entitled authority that aids in managing and controlling
                the functions of commonwealth reserves under the EPBC Act. The practices typically include the
                safeguarding and management of biodiversity aspects in protecting the commonwealth reserves. This has
                also declared provisions for commonwealth marine reserves which works in the area of sea and which is
                also governed by Governor- General of Australia. The authority is responsible in speaking about the area
                from the seaward boundary of State and Northern Territory coastal waters to the exterior of the
                Exclusive Economic Zone 200 nautical miles which is also far from the territorial sea baseline.
            </p>
            <p>However, the areas that comes outside Australia have several legal aspects which protects the
                international agreement and which also gives several guidelines about the protection of marine parks. In
                addition to this, the EPBC Act also contains a procedural value that needs to be adhered before
                declaring the intervention of a commonwealth reserve. This procedure also focuses on determining the
                notice that invites public authorities on the proposal and afterwards it declares a commonwealth
                reserve. Thus, along with this, diverse stages are also includes which needs to be considered if reserve
                needs to be satisfied under the established guidelines. It is also essential for the entities to include
                proclamation declaration which considers name of the reserve, purpose regarding its declaration, depth
                of the seabed under any sea that exists there in the reserve and assigning the reserve to an IUCN
                category.
            </p>
            <p>This announcement is essential in terms of segregating a reserve into different zones and at the same
                time it should also assign IUCN category to each zone. IUCN categories usually ensures appropriateness
                in specifying the protective aspects of diverse areas. For instance- the Australian Government has also
                emphasized on the World Conservation Union’s on international basis which has also recognized set of
                protected area management categories. In this respect, commonwealth marine protected areas include
                reserves which are concerned with IUCN category. Besides this, there are various commonwealth marine
                reserves general administrative principles which needs to be followed so that conservation aspects can
                be managed appropriately. This also needs to have community participation so that it can provide broader
                extent in the context of participation from community, public organizations and private interests in
                formulating and conducting all the function of the reserve or zone.
            </p>
            <p>This also includes the provision of effective and adaptive management which are related to the aim
                defined under biodiversity and also with the socio economic facets that specifies the reserve zone. This
                should be appropriate to include so as to ensure a capacity to respond to risk and transformations.
                Apart from this, different management plans are being prepared in the context of providing protection to
                the reserv. Furthermore, management needs to be consistent with all the relevant reserve management
                principles and at the same time it also limits several activities that are performed in a commonwealth
                reserve unless they are specified by the management plan which focuses on protecting the reserves by the
                Director of National Parks.

            <h4>QUESTION 3
            </h4>
            <h5>Interpreting the technical requirements and importance of international accounting standards
            </h5>
            <p>International Accounting standards have high level of importance which ensures high level transparency
                and standardization in the financial statements. Hence, final accounts which are prepared according to
                IFRS are highly reliable in nature and thereby helps stakeholders in making decisions (Florou, Kosi and
                Pope, 2017). However, technical knowledge is highly required among the individuals or accounting
                personnel to deal with the aspects of International Accounting Standards such as IAS 12 and 26 etc. In
                this, accounting personnel must have ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities. Moreover,
                assets, revenue received in advance, other liabilities, unrecognized items; consolidated financial
                statements are the main bases of taxation (Warren, 2016). By taking into consideration all such bases
                accounting personnel can assess or determine the tax liability. In addition to this, in IAS 12 contains
                rules regarding the measurement of deferred tax. Along with this, tax rate are also varied from one year
                to another. In this, accounting personnel is required to update with changing rules and policies.
                Through this, finance manager and accounting personnel would become able to determine suitable tax
                liability. In addition to this, IAS 26 serves information about retirement plans which can be
                distinguished into two types such as defined benefit and contribution plan. Hence, it clearly presents
                information about the recording, measurement and disclosure of information regarding the retirement
                benefit plans. Hence, for effective presentation accounting personnel must have knowledge regarding the
                rules and regulations which are related to it (Bond, Govendir and Wells, 2016). Thus, by considering all
                such aspects it can be said that technical and conceptual knowledge is highly required for dealing with
                the standards more effectively and efficiently. Moreover, reporting and measurement aspect of pension
                plan is highly differing from one standard to another (McPhail, Macdonald and Ferguson, 2016). For
                instance: UK GAAP has different rules in relation to treatment on pension benefits in against to IAS.
                Hence, conceptual understanding and knowledge is highly required for dealing with the amount of
                retirement benefits and deferred tax amount. There are several key issues which are associated with
                financial reporting enumerated below:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reporting needs and requirements are mentioned in the regulations which business entity requires
                    following for ensuring transparency in the final accounts. However, sometimes is not possible for
                    the business organization to comply with all the rules to the large extent.
                </li>
                <li>Further, some government authorities have framed and introduced legislation which entail that
                    companies are not obliged to prepare financial statements according to accounting standards.
                    Moreover, sometimes treasurer directives also enforce accounting standard which company has to
                    follow for the preparation of financial statements.
