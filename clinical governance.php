The injury that is caused due to falls and fall are the most common and serious medical problems that are faced by older adults (Granacher, Gollhofer and Muehlbauer, 2013). When a person is facing serious health issues and when a fall occurs, then the condition becomes worse. As per the data, it can be stated that about 1/3 of the people every year fall and half of them fall twice. This type of issues occur because of decreased reflexes and mobility and underlying osteoporosis. Results of fall causes fractures, head injury and most of the cases even death. This research will cover different type of secondary research done on this topic. </p> <h5>Background of Study</h5> <p>There are different type of research done on fall prevention. This study will enable to provide proper information about the issues and strategies that are implemented by health and social care so that they will be able to reduce its impact and older people can be provided with better services (DiBardino, Cohen and Didwania, 2012). In this context, below given are five researches that are done on fall prevention: </p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-1"></div> <div class="col-1"><b>Author</b> </div> <div class="col-2"><b>Aims</b> </div> <div class="col-2"><b>Sample/setting </b></div> <div class="col-2"><b>Design/methods </b></div> <div class="col-2"><b>Main findings </b></div> <div class="col-2"><b>Strengths/limitations </b></div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-1"><b>Article 1</b> </div> <div class="col-1">Dykes.

When compared with the other articles there are no research that has been done in this area. This shows that there are accidents that take place in the hospitals and it is important that professional take appropriate steps to reduce the impact. Healthcare professionals should be given with fall prevention tool kit so that accidents of fall can be reduced. </p> <p>In the finding, it can be stated that there are different type of programmes or strategies that are implemented in order to reduce fall. The second article talks about exercise programmes in order to reduce injury in community (El-Khoury, Cassou and et.al., 2013). Both article 1 and article 2 are similar but the strategies that are used is different. Further, there are about 4305 participants involved and all were taken above the age of 60. In addition to this, 17 trials were conducted. All these analyses were helpful enough to come up with appropriate solution that exercise programmes were helpful. </p> <p>In article 3 there are no participants taken as all the article is based on different secondary research that has already been done by different researchers. This article is helpful to know the main causes due to which fall occur (Annweiler, Montero-Odasso and et.al., 2010). This is generally after the age of 60 when eyes, bones and muscles gets weaker. In such situation, one of the major element that are helpful is Vitamin D which is important in the body so as to make sure that the fall can be reduced and this is been done by providing proper diet. </p> <p>Article 1, 2 and 4 are similar as they all talk about different strategies which can be implemented with the help of which falls can be reduced. In this article, researcher talks about inpatient fall prevention program in which professional will make sure that all they all precaution is taken and they are provided with proper safety is provided to them so that they will be able to make sure that falls can be reduced and older people can provided with proper safety (Miake-Lye, Hempel and et.al., 2013). Further, this study includes 4 meta analyse and 19 studies involved which makes this study more reliable and effective. </p> <p>In article 5, researcher talks about providing professional or seniors with proper training so that they will be able to make sure that they provide safe services to old people. This article is different from other researches (Bridenbaugh and Kressig, 2010). When compared with all the other research this research is done over the professionals and rest others are done over old people or patients who are above the age of 60 years. </p> <p>Findings</p> <p>As per the findings that has been identified from the essay is that mostly all except for one make use of qualitative research. Further, it can be determined that there are different set of strategies and programs that can be used in order to reduce or eliminate the causes of fall (Pynoos Steinman and Nguyen, 2010). Moreover, the fall issues are less to young people and even if they fall their body have that strength to recover the damage caused. On the other hand, old age people, if they fall then it may cause them serious issues and in most of the cases there are also chances of death. </p> <h5>Conclusion</h5> <p>From this finding, it can be articulated that implementation of fall prevention programmes are highly beneficial and they play vital role in reducing he impacts of fall (DiBardino, Cohen and Didwania, 2012). Most of the drops occur due to medical conditions that are faced by old people. The treatments to falls is highly expensive when compared with other issues that are caused. Fall can be reduced at great extent when the programs are implemented or applied effectively and efficiently. </p> <h5>References</h5> <ul> <li>Annweiler, C., Montero-Odasso, M. and et.al., 2010.
