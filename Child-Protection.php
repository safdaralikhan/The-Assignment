            <h3>Report on Child Protection and Legislation
            </h3>
            <h3>INTRODUCTION TO CHILD PROTECTION AND LEGISLATION
            </h3>
            <p>Every nation within UK holds the responsibility of formulating its policies as well as laws that hover
                around education, social-welfare and health. Laws are frequently formulated for prevention of behaviour
                that could harm a child. This also has inclusion of required actions that keep children same from any
                harm. As per the current statistics, near about 57,000 children have been found out who need to be
                protected from abuse in UK (Johns, 2017). In response to this there are nearly about 93,000 children
                under care within UK. So the report will throw light upon various aspects of child abuse in UK as well
                as the associated legislation for protection of children against any harm caused.
            </p>
            <h4>FACT-SHEET 1 → TYPES OF ABUSE
            </h4>
            <p>At a given time a could be made subjected to more than one forms of abuses. The child abuse can be
                classified into four official categories that have been briefly discussed below
            </p>
            <h5>Emotional Abuse
            </h5>
            <p>This type of abuse is usually found out in between the relationship that exists among a child and his/her
                parent/carer. This is instead not an outcome of patterned events or either a specific event. This
                usually occurs when needs such as approval, consistency, affection and security are not met. All these
                come under the category of developmental needs. The manifestation of child abuse could be found out by
                the behavioural, affective, cognitive or either the way of physically-functioning of a child. Some
                common examples include : insecure-attachment, unhappy, lower self-esteem, underachieved education.
            </p>
            <h5>Sexual Abuse
            </h5>
            <p>This type of abuses occur when a child is forced to take part in sexual activities despite considering
                that whether they are aware or not. The examples include acts of violence, inappropriately touching,
                making them watch inappropriate sexual-activities. In such abuses both males and females could be found
                to solely perpetrate them.
            </p>
            <h5>Physical Abuse
            </h5>
            <p>Such abuses usually result in actually or potentially harming a child physical way by lesser
                interactions, which comes under control of parents or any other responsible or trusted person. There is
                a possibility that either single or multiple repetitive incidents could occur. Examples of such abuses
                include either induced or fabricated illness. Symptoms of such abuse could not be clearly explained by
                aid of medical tests and usually are observed by a parent/carer when they pay visit to their child at
                hospital.
            </p>
            <h5>Neglect
            </h5>
            <p>It could be described within the terminology of omission in which children suffer from either impaired
                development or any other sort of significant-harm. These abuses occur because of being deprived from
                having food, clothes, warmness, safety, supervising, getting attached towards affection provided from
                adults or providing medical-care. For example, not providing adequate nutrition to child may affect
                his/her height or weight which might turn out to be significantly lower than it should be. If child has
                been consistently deprived from intellectual-simulation then he/she might be missing the classes in
                school.
            </p>
            <h4>Defining ‘Harm’ and ‘Significant-harm’
            </h4>
            <p>The ill-treating of or impairing health/development of child comes under harm. Determining whether the
                harm is significant or not is done by comparing him/her with another child of same age on the parameters
                of development & health. When the well-being of a child along with his/her development is getting
                affected in a severe manner then, significant harm’s threshold is reached.
            </p>
            <h4>FACT-SHEET 2 → INDICATORS OF THE ABUSE
            </h4>
            <h5>Indicators of Emotional Abuse
            </h5>
            <ul>
                <li>There is an observable delay in development.
                </li>
                <li>When child has failed to get attached to someone.
                </li>
                <li>The child is behaving in aggressive manner towards other individuals.
                </li>
                <li>The lack of self-esteem and confidence within the child.
                </li>
                <li>When child is being seen as a loner and faces difficulty while trying to relate with other children
                    or individuals.
                </li>
                <li>When he/she is being scapegoated in their family.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Commenting on the fact that these are indicators of emotional abuse, a crucial part is involved. These
                indicators are often found out to hurt the inner self of children that at times makes them depressed.
                The reason that these indicators are abuse is because the child is being emotionally affected by certain
                events occurring in their lives. They get affected in adverse way which is a type of abuse only. These
                are found out by the behaviour shown by children. Also, this behaviour could turn out to be an indicator
                of another type of abuse as well.
            </p>
            <h5>Indicators of Sexual Abuse
            </h5>
            <ul>
                <li>When there is in-appropriable sexual-conduct.
                </li>
                <li>When the child has sexual-knowledge which is very inappropriate considering their age.
                </li>
                <li>When the children harm themselves or attempt to suicide.
                </li>
                <li>They are not able to concentrate properly and face problems in learning methods.
                </li>
                <li>They are anxiously unwilling to their clothes for attending any event such as sports or other.
                </li>
                <li>When paining of genital areas of a child is observed.
                </li>
                <li>When blood traces are found out on the under-clothes of child.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Both types of gender in children could be found out out to be the victims of sexual abuse (Ferguson,
                2011). The inappropriate acts done to a child affect their physical health and poses a impact on their
                behaviour as well. The child is unable to cope up with extra curricular activities and does not
                effectively takes part in any other conversations with friends or family.
            </p>
            <h5>Indicators of Physical Abuse
            </h5>
            <ul>
                <li>When bruises are observed on body of a pre-crawling babies.
                </li>
                <li>When fractures that is swelling of a body part of child is observed.
                </li>
                <li>When trauma is observed.
                </li>
                <li>When in X-Ray a bone is found out to be infected.
                </li>
                <li>When internal injuries are seen after consulting the doctor that causes a lot of pain.
                </li>
                <li>Because of a parent’s negligence children ingesting tablets could turn out to be domestic poisoning.
                </li>
                <li>Marks of bites, burns or any scars are observed over the body of child.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Such abuses affects the child’s body in an adverse manner. The child could possibly lose their certain
                abilities of walking, talking etc. because of such an abuse. Such abuses could also possibly cause death
                to a child if severe injuries are observed.
            </p>
            <h5>Indicators of Neglect
            </h5>
            <ul>
                <li>When the child is significantly shorter or is under-weighted than he/should be as per the
                    chronological-age.
                </li>
                <li>When the skin of child is found out to be either in poor condition it is coldly mottled.
                </li>
                <li>When the swelling of the limbs is observed.
                </li>
                <li>The sores and cuts are not able to be healed quickly.
                </li>
                <li>The sores and cuts are not able to be healed quickly.
                </li>
                <li>When poor diet is given to children which might cause diseases such as diarrhoea.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Act of neglecting often causes some serious problems or diseases to a child. However, these acts of
                neglect are very difficult to observe. Act of neglecting often affects the health of child. So in order
                for finding them, proper health and social care professionals should be considered.
            </p>
            <h4>FACT-SHEET 3 → PROFESSIONALS WORKING TOGETHER FOR REDUCTION IN ABUSES
            </h4>
            <p>Civil-law and criminal-law are the two broad categories of legislation that cover child-protection. Civil
                law has been further divided into public and private laws. Under public-law risks imposed on children
                are minimised and also the required action which has to be taken when child is found under risk. On the
                other hand, private laws allows the professionals to carry with the family proceedings. The criminal-law
                deals with individuals who offend against children. Keeping all these in mind, NSPCC was formulated in
                1884 in order to influence and draft the legislation for protecting the children’s.
            </p>
            <p>Existence of laws regarding child-abuse has been observed at local, federal as well as state levels. The
                federal government in the year 1974 passed the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA), and in
                2010 reauthorized it. Under this legislation, all the children are assured to be treated in an ethical,
                legal as well as fair manner. This act also protect a child from any form of emotional, physical,
                neglect and sexual abuses.
            </p>
            <p>The currently followed child protection system is on the basis of The Children Act of 1989. It formulates
                a list of details regarding local authorities the methodology that court shall adopt for protecting the
                child’s welfare. Its section 31 enables the NSPCC (National Society For Prevention Of Cruelty To
                Children) necessary power to directly imply court’s orders if as per it, any child is likely to suffer
                significant harms (Child protection in the UK, 2017). The act defines the ‘harm’ as a type of
                ill-treatment or impaired/develpment health. But no specific claims have been mentioned about
                ‘significant-harm’. So, its the court’s responsibility for deciding what could possibly be a significant
                harm by observing each an every aspect of case. Furthermore, Acts such as the Criminal Justice and
                Immigration, 2008, causes the people who sexually abuse children, face the prosecution in UK. In
                addition the children are also provided necessary justice as well as protection regarding sexual abuses
                by The Sexual Offences Act of 2003.
            </p>
            <p>A certain set of professionals are established as mandatory-reporters by aid of mandatory reporter laws.
                If any sort of abuse is suspected to be occurring on a child, then mandatory laws enables the people
                closely working with children within their profession, to alert the police. Also these laws have further
                stated that penalties will be there if failure is observed in the reporting of abuse.
            </p>
            <p>For filing a lawsuit, statue of limitations provides the deadline. According to this, lawsuit should be
                filed within the time limit as soon as the crime has been occurred or discovered.
            </p>
            <h4>WRITTEN ADVICE FOR NURSERY MANAGER
            </h4>
            <p>Yasmin always wants to be in charge of her activities. This makes her go into a state of distress when
                other children do not follow her. This trait of behaviour might be a possible outcome or indicator of
                emotional abuse. If any children does not listen to her, she suddenly gets aggressive which is an
                indicative of dealing with stress or fear that she might be neglected by other children. Her
                inappropriate behaviour from the past 3 months is possible indicative that she is definitely suffering
                from some kind of abuse in the nursery. This could be said so because she for long hours watches TV and
                also in her art works, she keeps on drawing circles. As defined by the sexual abuse definition in UK,
                there is possibility that Yasmin could have watched some inappropriate content that have caused such a
                behaviour. Henceforth, general manager should carry on further investigation and if any case of sexual
                abuse is found out then, as per the Sexual Offences Act, necessary prosecutions should be carried out.
            </p>
            <p>Also, as stated by Yasmin to Vicky, she is tensed about the relationship of her mother and her
                boyfriends. She is emotionally getting abused which is directly affecting her behavioural traits. There
                is a possibility that her mother’s friends have been sexually abusing her or ill treating because of
                which she is showing this concern So this could possibly come under both physical and sexual abuses.
                Also, she might have seen them fighting which have emotionally impacted her. Also, the abusive behaviour
                shown by her towards the other children could be the possible result of emotional abuse being faced by
                her.
            </p>
            <p>The symptoms which are currently observed in case of Yasmin are a result of emotional abuse and if proper
                investigation is carried it is possible that a case of sexual abuse is also to be there. So, NSPCC shall
                be consulted to directly do the prosecution in court under the clauses of CAPTA, The Sexual Offences
                Act, Criminal Justice and Immigration Act, The Children Act (Humphreys and Absler, 2011). The clause of
                Sexual Offences Act and Criminal Justice and Immigration Act shall be used only if necessary evidences
                and in case evidence are not found Yasmin could be treated in proper way so that she confesses her
                reason for such behaviour.
            </p>
            <h4>CONCLUSION
            </h4>
            <p>In every possible manner child should be provided protection from any sort of abuses. The legislations of
                UK are pretty much effective enough to carry on with the prosecution of such cases. Filing of case
                should be immediately done within the deadline as the discovery of any such child-abuse is observed. In
                addition, every citizen must try to be aware about their surrounding environment. They should
                immediately alert police if any sort of child-abuse is observed so that children could be provided a
                safe environment that prevents them from any harm.

            <h4>QUESTION 3
            </h4>
            <h5>Interpreting the technical requirements and importance of international accounting standards
            </h5>
            <p>International Accounting standards have high level of importance which ensures high level transparency
                and standardization in the financial statements. Hence, final accounts which are prepared according to
                IFRS are highly reliable in nature and thereby helps stakeholders in making decisions (Florou, Kosi and
                Pope, 2017). However, technical knowledge is highly required among the individuals or accounting
                personnel to deal with the aspects of International Accounting Standards such as IAS 12 and 26 etc. In
                this, accounting personnel must have ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities. Moreover,
                assets, revenue received in advance, other liabilities, unrecognized items; consolidated financial
                statements are the main bases of taxation (Warren, 2016). By taking into consideration all such bases
                accounting personnel can assess or determine the tax liability. In addition to this, in IAS 12 contains
                rules regarding the measurement of deferred tax. Along with this, tax rate are also varied from one year
                to another. In this, accounting personnel is required to update with changing rules and policies.
                Through this, finance manager and accounting personnel would become able to determine suitable tax
                liability. In addition to this, IAS 26 serves information about retirement plans which can be
                distinguished into two types such as defined benefit and contribution plan. Hence, it clearly presents
                information about the recording, measurement and disclosure of information regarding the retirement
                benefit plans. Hence, for effective presentation accounting personnel must have knowledge regarding the
                rules and regulations which are related to it (Bond, Govendir and Wells, 2016). Thus, by considering all
                such aspects it can be said that technical and conceptual knowledge is highly required for dealing with
                the standards more effectively and efficiently. Moreover, reporting and measurement aspect of pension
                plan is highly differing from one standard to another (McPhail, Macdonald and Ferguson, 2016). For
                instance: UK GAAP has different rules in relation to treatment on pension benefits in against to IAS.
                Hence, conceptual understanding and knowledge is highly required for dealing with the amount of
                retirement benefits and deferred tax amount. There are several key issues which are associated with
                financial reporting enumerated below:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reporting needs and requirements are mentioned in the regulations which business entity requires
                    following for ensuring transparency in the final accounts. However, sometimes is not possible for
                    the business organization to comply with all the rules to the large extent.
                </li>
                <li>Further, some government authorities have framed and introduced legislation which entail that
                    companies are not obliged to prepare financial statements according to accounting standards.
                    Moreover, sometimes treasurer directives also enforce accounting standard which company has to
                    follow for the preparation of financial statements.
