                <p>The main reasons of decline in sales of firm
                </p>
                <p>According to the view of Kirilenko, Kyle and Tuzun, (2017)it's far said that there are numerous cause
                    of declined in income which result in effect the profitability of an agency. Sales of product may be
                    declined as it now no longer fulfils the wishes and call for of client. If enterprise fail in making
                    product and offerings as according to flavor and choice of consumer, then it at once influences
                    sale. In present day era, wishes and call for of human beings alternate with alternate in time. They
                    appearance out for brand spanking new matters rather than happening with present product. Needs and
                    call for of human beings will increase time to time and it makes hard for an agency to fulfil the
                    want and desires of time. This lower the pleasure degree of client and that they transfer to
                    different emblem product in recognize to fulfil their want and desires. Further, there are numerous
                    competition in retail enterprise who make comparable sort of merchandise for client and sale them at
                    decrease pricer. Increase in opposition degree additionally effect the sale of particular agency.
                    Moreover, to live to tell the tale in aggressive marketplace organization want to decrease the rate
                    of its product and offerings which effect the income of an agency. Therefore, growth in opposition
                    degree additionally decline sale which at once effect income of a enterprise. Pouliot and Babcock,
                    (2016) defined that if an agency now no longer use powerful advertising approach then it
                    additionally decreases the sale. Company make exclusive sort of product and offerings for its
                    client, however it want to make sure that client understand approximately its product and offerings
                    or now no longer. Moreover, if enterprise now no longer make its client aware of product and
                    offerings which they may be promoting then human beings will now no longer select to shop for them.
                    As, it could be said that human beings select to shop for famous emblem product. So useless
                    advertising approach additionally effect the sale of agency which at once effect the profitability.
                    Furthermore, if enterprise now no longer make suitable exceptional of product and offerings then
                    client won't want to shop for specific organization product and offerings. It is essential for an
                    agency to recognition on exceptional of product as client specially choose to exceptional on the
                    time of purchasing product and offerings.</p>
                <h5>The impact of declining in sales of Sainsbury on the profitability of firm.
</h5>
                <p>According to the view of Feletto, Burton and Egger, (2017) decline in sale lead to impact the
                    profitability of an organization. If sale is declined then it impacts profit because company make
                    product for its customer and if they not buy product and services then it impact sale. Some time
                    company invest huge fund in making high quality product and services and attractive packaging.
                    Further if people not like to but those products then company cannot recover its making charges and
                    unable to make profit. Along with this organization also invest huge expenses in marketing its
                    product and services but due to high price of product customer avoid buying those expensive product
                    may decrease the profit of an organization. Increase in level of competition also diver the mind of
                    customer in buying particular company product and services. There are more choice available for
                    shopper and different company provide discount offer to its customer which grab the attention of
                    large number of customers. This impact sale as well as profit of other organization. Furthermore, if
                    sale is not increase then company cannot make profit to pay salary and wages to its employees.
                    Therefore, it can be stated that sale is very important for an organization in order to make huge
                    profit.
                </p>
                <h5>Strategies through which declining in sales could be overcome.
</h5>
                <p>Guo and Xiong, (2016) explained that there are different strategies which company can adopt in order
                    to increase sale and make huge profit. One of the effective strategy which an organization can used
                    is effective marketing techniques. Through this company can easily enhance the sale of its product
                    and services. Further it supports in making aware people about the product and services. Company can
                    use modern marketing techniques such as social networking site. Through the help of this company can
                    easily target large number of customer in less time. Company can provide detail information of its
                    product on social networking site for grabbing the attention of large number of customer.
                    Furthermore, there are many advance technology which can be used for making innovative product and
                    services for its customer. If company used new technology and make product which were different from
                    its competitor, then it can easily increase sale. Further, if products are different from its
                    competitor then company can easily keep high price of its product because then it has less
                    competitor. This assist organization in making huge profit. As pre view of Mohammadtalebi, Nasr and
                    Mohammadtalebi, (2016) a company can make product and services focus on fulfilling the needs and
                    demand of its customer in order to overcome decline of sale. For this purpose, firm can conduct
                    marker research for identifying the needs and demand of its customer and focus on making product
                    according to the taste and preference of customer. With the changes in time needs and demand of
                    people also changes, through the help of market research company can easily in identify the needs of
                    people and fulfils it. Further if firm get product as per their needs and want then they will not
                    switch to other brand. Apart from this Company need to ensure that product and services which they
                    are making is of good quality and grab the attention of people. This overall increase sale as well
                    as profit of an organization.
                </p>
                <h5>Research Methodology
</h5>
                <p>Presentation of Research and Evidence
                </p>
                <p>The research study basically aims to emphasize on the factors that leads to decline the ratio of
                    sales in Sainsbury; hence according to the research aim, researcher has used various primary and
                    secondary sources (Wirtz, 2012). Herein, this section provides detailed analysis about the
                    information collected from primary and secondary both the sources. Since, books, journals and
                    articles are being accessed in the research work; therefore on that basis, several factors are being
                    explored that has a direct link with company’s sales prospect. While carrying out the study,
                    attention has been given towards the factors that have a direct impact on declining the sales and
                    profitability aspects of the business. Moreover, in this regard it can be said that due to
                    increasing level of competition, company’s profitability aspect is reducing (Stahlberg and Maila,
                    2013). On the basis of secondary research, it is also ascertained that employees are required to
                    focus on enhancing the service provision dimension so that it can have a direct impact on company’s
                    profitability and success facets. This can be supported with an example which states that customers
                    always prefer to purchase products from those business entities which are highly focused on quality
                    dimension (Siu, 2012). However, currently the sales ratio of Sainsbury also seems to reduce because
                    somewhere Sainsbury is not meeting all the quality dimensions. Apart from this, the use of primary
                    source also depicts that Sainsbury is losing its market share because the business has been focusing
                    on multiple services which not only impacts the sales; but also disturbs other operations.
