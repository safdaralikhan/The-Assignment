                    <p>While I changed into in university, there has been a feature organised for World Youth Skills Day
                        in auditorium. For that day, a opposition changed into additionally organized through university
                        faculties. Herein, college students had been alleged to paintings in a crew of 10 human beings
                        and put together a electricity factor presentation of 10 minutes. This presentation changed into
                        to be primarily based totally upon the achievement completed through any multi-countrywide

                        finish all of the duties and important instruction associated with presentation in four
                        conferences. During our first assembly, we amassed and mentioned all of the pre specifications
                        for the PPT. Also, the allotment of character duties for anyone changed into performed then. I
                        changed into assigned duties, one changed into to make all preparations for assembly and 2d
                        changed into to put together the Presentation in the end. Both of them had been hard duties with
                        out which the paintings given to us couldn't be completed. Also, the complexity in terms of
                        arranging for conferences changed into that anyone had a distinctive time desk which made it
                        harder for me to reach at a time whilst all 10 folks had been free. By having character
                        conversations with all of them, I changed into capable of set up conferences put up which the
                        evaluations and perspectives in terms of concern count had been shared and compiled. When all
                        important records and numerical figures had been efficiently organised, I in the end created a
                        Power Point Presentation. When this PPT changed into offered in the front of complete

            <h4>QUESTION 3
            </h4>
            <h5>Interpreting the technical requirements and importance of international accounting standards
            </h5>
            <p>International Accounting standards have high level of importance which ensures high level transparency
                and standardization in the financial statements. Hence, final accounts which are prepared according to
                IFRS are highly reliable in nature and thereby helps stakeholders in making decisions (Florou, Kosi and
                Pope, 2017). However, technical knowledge is highly required among the individuals or accounting
                personnel to deal with the aspects of International Accounting Standards such as IAS 12 and 26 etc. In
                this, accounting personnel must have ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities. Moreover,
                assets, revenue received in advance, other liabilities, unrecognized items; consolidated financial
                statements are the main bases of taxation (Warren, 2016). By taking into consideration all such bases
                accounting personnel can assess or determine the tax liability. In addition to this, in IAS 12 contains
                rules regarding the measurement of deferred tax. Along with this, tax rate are also varied from one year
                to another. In this, accounting personnel is required to update with changing rules and policies.
                Through this, finance manager and accounting personnel would become able to determine suitable tax
                liability. In addition to this, IAS 26 serves information about retirement plans which can be
                distinguished into two types such as defined benefit and contribution plan. Hence, it clearly presents
                information about the recording, measurement and disclosure of information regarding the retirement
                benefit plans. Hence, for effective presentation accounting personnel must have knowledge regarding the
                rules and regulations which are related to it (Bond, Govendir and Wells, 2016). Thus, by considering all
                such aspects it can be said that technical and conceptual knowledge is highly required for dealing with
                the standards more effectively and efficiently. Moreover, reporting and measurement aspect of pension
                plan is highly differing from one standard to another (McPhail, Macdonald and Ferguson, 2016). For
                instance: UK GAAP has different rules in relation to treatment on pension benefits in against to IAS.
                Hence, conceptual understanding and knowledge is highly required for dealing with the amount of
                retirement benefits and deferred tax amount. There are several key issues which are associated with
                financial reporting enumerated below:

            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Reporting desires and necessities are stated withinside the guidelines which commercial enterprise
                    entity calls for following for making sure transparency withinside the very last accounts. However,
                    occasionally isn't always viable for the commercial enterprise agency to conform with all of the
                    regulations to the huge extent.</li>
                <li>Further, a few authorities government have framed and added law which entail that corporations
                    aren't obliged to put together economic statements consistent with accounting standards. Moreover,
                    once in a while treasurer directives additionally implement accounting trendy which employer has to
                    observe for the guidance of economic statements.</li>
