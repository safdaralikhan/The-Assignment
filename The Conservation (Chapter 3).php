                <h3>Report on Role Of The Precautionary Principle In The Conservation (Chapter 3)
                </h3>
                <p>Challenges in implementing the precautionary principle in the conservation and sustainable use of marine
                    biodiversity
                </p>
                <p>Translating principles into practice
                </p>
                <p>In the last three decades, there has been sufficient growth in the volume and importance of environmental
                    law and policy. This has brought many significant improvements at the time of managing the environmental
                    which also generates important question regarding the ways through which public and private institutions
                    could manage scientific uncertainty at the time of undertaking decision regarding the practices which
                    impacts the environment on diverse grounds. In this respect, it can be said that the precautionary
                    principle is greatly adopted by several bodies that aids in generating the solution and this collection
                    is also crucial in terms of exploring its potential. Overall level of environmental degradation is
                    increasing; thus considering the same Environmental related laws have been developed. Considering the
                    same, it can be said that some of the damage is not surprising. Cause- effect relationship have been
                    clear; however at the same time political, economic and social trade- offs have allowed the damaging
                    actions to occur since it keeps on changing. In a few cases, there has been scientific uncertainty
                    regarding the outcomes of the actions; but it also generates a reasonable possibility that results in
                    damaging the environment. However, in other situations, negative outcomes have been a surprise as the
                    activities have been thought to be safe and secure. The exhaustion that happens in the stratospheric
                    ozone layer through emissions of chlorofluorocarbons is one of the examples of such thing. Thus, it
                    should be made clear immediately that the precautionary principle is greatly integrated with the second
                    of these examples wherein situations shows scientific uncertainty which is also recognized in regard to
                    the environmental outcomes of our activity. Therefore, it is essential to find out the requirement to
                    deal with scientific uncertainty that has been a recurring theme in environmental law and policy.
                    Recognition of increasing environmental degradation by the early 1970s have generated the need of
                    critical decision making process and tools that aids to expect harm from human activities. Thus,
                    according to that, appropriate measures needs to be taken for the purpose of migrating or preventing
                    damage. Thus, as per the analysis, precautionary principle can be considered as an approach that has
                    always been taken to some extent for the purpose of protecting environmental dimensions. Therefore, it
                    is also identified that a number of themes have been developed in social science, philosophy and law
                    which together have led to the precautionary principle. This can be regarded as a logical conclusion
                    which brings numerous development which occurs both on practical and philosophical levels especially in
                    western culture. Henceforth, it includes the failure of environmental management approaches such as the
                    assimilative capacity approach and risk assessment to stop environmental degradation. This also gives
                    acceptance of the concept of intergenerational equity; thus legal concerns are increasing over the
                    problems with the burden of proof in environmental matters. At the same time, it also increases
                    awareness of the complexity of environmental issues; hence this has emerged the concept of new sciences
                    which includes Chaos theory and which also brings many questions related to the practices that are based
                    on simple models of preventing the environment. At the time of implementing precautionary principle into
                    practice, several issues arise such as execution of policy into practice. Since, it includes several
                    stages; therefore it is crucial to consider all the principal facets. Such framework is also useful in
                    providing aid so as to implement the rules mentioned in the precautionary principle which also aids in
                    conserving biodiversity and natural resource management. These guidelines are being formulated because
                    it crucially focuses on forestry, fisheries and protected areas. Incorporating the precautionary
                    principle explicitly should be there on appropriate level so that policy framework could be changed
                    accordingly. This could also result in conservation of natural resource management. Thus, it can be said
                    that application of the principle needs to have a legal policy which has adequate control through the
                    organized system of governance. At the same time, it has also led to the development of resource
                    institutions that aids in carrying out several research regarding challenges and issues that is
                    concerned with decision making aspects about the protection of natural resource management. Furthermore,
                    there must a concise and particular aspect that defines measures that deals in operational values and
                    this must be clearly implemented so as to reach towards specific outcomes. Thus, in terms of stating
                    about the effects of conservation, it needs to translate the policy formation with operational measures
                    so that the issues related to conservation problems can be ascertained and it also identifies practices
                    that needs to be adopted in specific areas. Therefore, the implementation is also necessary as there is
                    a need for flexibility and it also requires particular decision aspects that are regarded with policy
                    measures. The support it provides also changes as per the time according to transformed circumstances.
                    For the purpose of safeguarding the environmental values, the precautionary principle is essential to be
                    implemented as per the capabilities of the states. The situations that are hazardous for the environment
                    should not allow the use of scientific certainty as it postpone cost as this is an effective way to
                    minimize the possible issues related to environment deprivation. Further, precautionary situations are
                    generally risk associated wherein casual chain (that moves from hazards to final impacts) shows some
                    uncertain effects because of the presence of casual relationship that can neither be established nor
                    rejected. Without the incorporation of these principles in law or policy, it may have little influence
                    on practice. However, at the same time, there is also a need for flexibility in applied principles that
                    requires specific decision and management policy measures in the same domain as it results in supporting
                    for conservation purposes. From the underlying challenges, it can be said that the threats that are
                    included in conservation and protection aspects have a huge impact on several and changeable activities
                    and decisive aspects. Therefore, all such reasons and hazardous elements are required to be addressed
                    suitably as it requires efforts that are made to determine the known and unknown facts. This also states
                    that the level of knowledge can be improvised; therefore there must be several aspects that can ignore
                    the areas of uncertainty. At the same time, it also brings several challenges that could lead to
                    conserve the resources by detecting and analysing the level of threats. Further, the frameworks is also
                    required to analyse diverse alternatives so that the best practical solution can be ascertained which
                    can also work in minimizing and reducing the level of threats. Therefore, at the same time, in this
                    respect it can be said that significances and challenges that are developed from such courses are
                    required to be accessed as such threats may have short term or long term effects. Proper roles and
                    responsibilities are also required to be allocated so that it can aid in managing all the activities
                    that are related to conservation of environment and biodiversity. However, if such thing includes
                    diverse additional groups that conducts their responsibilities and investment aspects that are highly
                    powerful in terms of financial and technical aspects. However, in some of the circumstances, there are
                    various alternatives present which will also develop different challenges related to environmental
                    conservation and in that case, the direction for accessing threats should be included. At the same time,
                    when several decisions are made to deal with the uncertain condition, it imperatively requires to be
                    apparent and to respond to the uncertainty so that the work of precautionary principle can be carried
                    out in suitable way. Along with this, it is also crucial to ensure that transparency is being maintained
                    and that it can provide a concise dimension that includes monitoring and feedback collection in decision
                    making procedure. In this aspect, a reasonable balance is required to be struck out among the measures
                    developed in precautionary conservative ways and this also have integration with several other aspects
                    that brings varied threats while implementing it. Thus, it highly needs to consider the level of
                    uncertainty especially at the time of dealing with precautionary principle.
                </p>
                <p>The process of implementing precautionary principle is relevant in all the variants of scientific
                    uncertainty that appears to have caused confusion and is on ongoing source of debate. Thus, in this
                    case, a precautionary approach can be regarded as highly useful component and process of ecosystem whose
                    impacts and consequences may develop other issues. This also generates other risks and challenges if not
                    implemented properly and this also occurs at the time when precautionary principle is applied.
                    Henceforth, precaution and risk management are not important until the risk factors are identified in
                    the situations that warranty proper execution of the precautionary principle. However, it also needs to
                    include all the situations that can be thought of as imposing potential risks. In terms of generalized
                    aspects, implementation of precautionary principle requires safeguarding environmental facets so that
                    species in the ecosystem can be managed suitably. However, on the other hand in several domains,
                    application of precautionary principle seems to be an unusual concept that requires proper strategic
                    implementation. While, on the other hand, several ways of precaution could also be executed as an
                    important dimension that aids in conserving the biodiversity and along with that, challenges also arise
                    while executing principles that requires consideration for a wide range of issues. Thus, the development
                    of the principle could affect other strategic aspects if they are not managed suitably. For example-
                    there are varied development aspects that lies in precautionary principle is included and also shows
                    lesser impacts on the execution procedure of precautionary principle which is an important aspect that
                    changes the execution procedure.
                </p>
                <p>Extent and nature of uncertainty
                </p>
                <p>It is identified that the operative measures are used for the purpose of executing precautionary
                    principle which also depicts its impacts and this definitely changes as per the requirements of the
                    environmental facets. This is greatly associated with the risk aspects through which it develops and the
                    capacity of interest risks that prevails in management practices and approaches. Therefore, it can be
                    said that up to a greater level, the generation of precautionary principle has led to development of
                    several issues which are uncertain; however they are related to the philosophy of the management.
                    Furthermore, it also make use of several values which are essential to safeguard the environment and
                    eco-system. These attributes have also changed the ways through which value of environment is depicted.
                    Contrary to this, there are a number of aspects that are concerned with biodiversity and that emerge
                    from this paradigm which sometimes also brings various consequences.
                </p>
                <p>The term uncertainty is apparently unpredictable and that aids in preservation and resource management
                    aspects. The categories of uncertainty can be split into two types which also vary from each other. One
                    is related to data omission which also changes the value of conservation and protection. It can be
                    connected with varied values such as improper availability of investigation and measurement biases. This
                    kind of uncertainty at least in precautionary principle can be solved through various investigation and
                    research processes. The second uncertainty is related to the inherent aspect lies in the system which is
                    also ascertained. Thus, the attributes of the system includes its complexities, scale, dynamics and
                    other things that aids in comprehending or predicting the outcomes that are impossible or highly
                    unreliable.</p>
                <p>In the area of biodiversity, uncertainty has several dimensions that changes the value of environmental
                    concern. Therefore, changes in the disturbances is poorly understood with the help of such principle.
                    Therefore, it can be said that association in ecologies (specifically the most bio diverse) consists of
                    numerous differentiating species which are interlinked with each other for developing the level of
                    interaction and this is also associated with those values that enhances nutritional values, temperature
                    aspects and hydrological systems. At the same time they also show how the ecosystem is related to varied
                    dimensions of the environment (which usually keeps on changing). This also involves experimentation
                    which comprises of those variables that cannot be developed possibly. While at the same time, it also
                    changes the level of uncertainty that is explored in biodiversity and conservation of natural resource
                    management which is being evaluated by the fact that it is known that how many species exist.
                </p>
                <p>Thus, it can be said that the pre-determined aspects of natural resource management is featured by the
                    fact of ecology and is also cannot be identified while focusing on scientific approaches. For instance –
                    when the species present in the ecology are clearly identified, decisions related to the management of
                    ecosystem needs to consider social, political and cultural values. Thus, it can be contended that in
                    this scenario within which the precautionary principle is evolved with the human behaviour is
                    consequently adopted on regulation. Thus, control of emissions generally leads to predictive reductions
                    and that has also brought quitting the hazardous chemical values which is included in the production of
                    the several conservative dimensions. However, most of the biodiversity conservation consists direct
                    association among natural values of the ecosystem and the associated factors.
                </p>
                <p>This also impact the decision regarding decrease in the fishery which also bans the use of toxic material
                    for wildlife products and that depends on biological attributes of the species of system; alongside it
                    also includes human responses to it. Therefore, it can be said that fisheries may develop the
                    restrictive facets; however this can also affect the trade aspects present in the wildlife; but it may
                    also adhere to various routes. Thus, it can also be said that it includes illegal aspects which also
                    creates issues in regulating it. In this respect, managing the decision making aspects can also include
                    not merely information concerned with science; but also it could include consideration of diverse
                    environmental factors that changes the protection facets. With a certain level, it depicts that the
                    association placed among precautionary principle and conservation action is not clarified and it may be
                    regarded as essential in terms of developing precautionary aspects. This also develops scope among
                    various aspects of precautionary principle and other dimensions that lies under this. This needs to be
                    executed with the variables that are essential for principle implementation. Therefore, it can be
                    articulated that there exists differences among threats under precautionary principle and conservation
                    of biodiversity in the realm of natural resource development and it can also be applied to industrial
                    applications.
                </p>
                <p>This has been an important question which is occurred in the domain of implementing precautionary
                    principle and which states that appeal of precautionary principle in domestic law and policy formation
                    has various effects on actual conservation results. For example- it is also observed that afterwards
                    several years of precaution which was executed as an important requirement under Australian environment
                    law. Further, it seems to have a few impacts on practical aspects of precautionary principle. The
                    development of the principle facets is also getting impacted if such legal flaws are initiated. At the
                    time when the obligation is developed it shows greater impact on decision making aspects which includes
                    all such provisions that are essential to reach towards a specific outcome. Whereas, in few of the
                    activities, precautionary principle can be regarded as a mandatory procedure than to practical
                    requirement. Therefore, it is also required to depict that while implementing precautionary principle,
                    it is essential to take specific decision about the policy formation.
                </p>
                <p>This also defines the operative measures that is vital to be executed while focusing on precautionary
                    principle and the impacts which it gives also keeps on changing according to diverse environmental
                    facets. This is also depending on the nature and source of risks which has different capacities of
                    interest groups. At the same time, it also prevails challenges while implementing different activities
                    and policies. However, up to a larger extent, the precautionary principle has been shown in integration
                    with several risks and challenges which includes marine pollution and that is also against the
                    prevailing management paradigm. At the same time, it also comprises different set of key interests that
                    are made for the purpose of protecting environmental facets. These attributes are also useful in terms
                    of showcasing the understanding of implementing of precautionary principle. Nonetheless, various
                    significant aspects in respect of biodiversity and NRM sectors which also deviate from this philosophy
                    along and brings several imperative consequences.
                </p>
                <p>However, along with this, it is also observed that most biodiversity and conservation scenario comprises
                    of concise interaction among natural ecosystem and factors present in the external environment. This
                    includes an example as well such as the impact of a decision whether on fishery or ban on wildlife
                    product which changes the biological characteristics of the system. This also states that fisheries may
                    also enhance the level of restrictions and trade in wildlife will not reduce: however it could adhere to
                    several aspects that may be regarded as illegal and insufficient which is also difficult to regulate.
                    Thus, managing things regarding decision making can develop several scientific facets which may also
                    show integration with environmental factors. Therefore, to a greater level, it emphasizes on the
                    developed edge among precautionary and preventive related to conservation of biodiversity and it does
                    not depict any specific aspect. Therefore, it can be said that most of the conservation and NRM measures
                    can be called as important variables which reflects the requirements of precautionary action which also
                    leaves scope that develops the ways through which precautionary principles can be applied. At the same
                    time, it applies measures which needs to be implemented in different courses of policy development.

                <p>Nature of threat to biodiversity and living natural resources
                </p>
                <p>According to the analysis, there has been a considerable difference between threats in precautionary
                    regulation and management in the biodiversity. It is also ascertained that the precautionary principle
                    is developed for the purpose of handling the contemporary aspects that is established through focusing
                    on changing legal processes which usually shows the outcomes of technical values such as industrial
                    chemicals, hormone treated livestock and nanotechnology. Thus, in this context it is analysed that in
                    the protection of biodiversity and living natural resources, challenges are present which can also be
                    observed by new devices and practices. This is truly a possible risk to biodiversity that is being
                    posted by those organisms that are genetically appeared. At the same time, challenges are also emerged
                    which are being developed by introduction of alien species that particularly leads to climatic changes.
                    This can also be observed as a new dimension in the realm of contemporary values.
                </p>
                <p>However, at the same time while ascertaining the challenges developed by habitat loss and degradation of
                    natural resources that can also impact the biological facets of the environment. This also explains that
                    there exist no new scientific aspects and processes. At the same time, there is no specific mystery
                    which is concerned with casual links that is also associated to a newly developed variable concerned
                    with technology. Still, the consequences of this difference is not clear yet. This also does not depict
                    anything regarding the ways through which scientific risk assessment and stakeholder consultation can be
                    carried out. This is usually adopted for the executing precautionary principle. This can be stated to
                    generalised sorts of threats. It also includes the provision of multiple risks which includes the
                    conceptual framework of precautionary principle. Thus, improper implementation of principles could also
                    lead to risks and challenges that may further impact the conservation of biodiversity. This also
                    generates the decisions to be taken among challenges and precautions.
                </p>
                <p>Nonetheless, at the same time, decision makers that works in conservation of NRM should come up with
                    numerous strategies so that the risks and challenges can be minimized. This also contends that if
                    prevention can be made through harvesting coral reefs, then they may explode the reef for cement. At the
                    same time, if harvesting is prohibited from medicinal plants and wild foods, then people may dislike
                    such contradictions and can also ask for transformation in the conservation areas. Therefore, it is
                    clearly said that management of eco-system for developing the value of species can generate economic
                    aspects and it can also lead to underpin the agriculture sector. However, it may also lead to
                    alternations regarding detrimental effects to other species. Hence, risks and challenges may also arise
                    because of diverse sources and this may also change due to time variations which requires the
                    application of precautionary principle.
                </p>
                <p>It also includes values and objectives in decision making which clearly depicts that implementation of
                    precautionary principle involves value judgement and the concept of trade-offs among diverse competing
                    objectives. In NRM and conservation, different norms and aspects created challenges and risks which also
                    shows that there exists greater diversity within the constituency and that leads to safeguarding the
                    environment. A few are associated with the obligations of the individual animals which depicts the
                    problems of the species after changing the procedure of policy formation. Whereas, some also focus on
                    enhancing the value of ecosystem services, maintenance of other services and balancing species and
                    ecosystem. These may also emphasize on several aspects that reduces the implication of ecosystem to
                    perform the same aspects. This happens because of the broad environmental community. Therefore, in
                    various decision making contexts, interest of other groups can be protected to raise the involvement.
                </p>
                <p>Thus, it can be said that execution of precautionary principle also addresses specific objectives that
                    are essential in terms of precautionary aspects and that also includes standards which are highly
                    suitable in terms of developing interaction among competing groups who have different values, objectives
                    and specifications. Similarly, the negative distributional consequence of precautionary management and
                    policy in the biodiversity and NRM and this may also have a detrimental impact on poor facets rather
                    than powerful. In current scenario, various analysis concerns the precautionary principle that also
                    proponents the threat causing activities. This also depicts powerful interests that stands to profit by
                    such activities. In this respect, the precautionary principle has been applied for the purpose of
                    preventing the public or the environment. This also comprises the burden that are established by the
                    application of precautionary principle and at the same time it also leads to several restrictions that
                    lies on import, emissions or other activities which deals with the same.
                </p>
                <p>Thus, it can be said that precautionary restrictions on use of wild resource can impact most serious
                    aspects on underdeveloped countries among poor people and this can equitably consider specific aspects
                    which are important from conservation point of view. From overview about precautionary principle, it is
                    being analysed that in the realm of biological resource management; there are several principles that
                    may not be directly opposed to such groups whose actions can develop further threats from environmental
                    grounds. In this respect, it has also been analysed that there exists several differences among
                    fisheries and pollution and the principles are typically developed for the purpose of surviving
                    capturing fisheries. Therefore, in the area of industrial applications, there exists several groups that
                    threaten the environment and also damage beneficial aspects. On the contrary, under such situations, it
                    is essential to consider how to utilize manage and administer trade biological resources such as
                    wildlife, forest products and fisheries which have a specific impact on eco-system and conservative
                    facets. Typically, such groups are useful in terms of enhancing the value of sustainable management.
                </p>
                <p>Therefore, it enhances the concern regarding precaution which is required to be implemented through
                    community level resource and wildlife management. It is also an anticipated aspect which showcases that
                    traditional and indigenous natural resource management does not exist on wider extent and this may also
                    comprise the requirement of precautionary elements. Thereafter, this also raises concern towards
                    implementing precaution in biodiversity conservation and NRM that specifically includes the use of
                    management policy and tools. It is also ascertained that the precautionary principle is highly executed
                    into practical terms because it has the nature of reversing the evidentiary burden. However, it requires
                    establishment of an assumption wherein most of the activities are not required to be included because of
                    the harmful elements it contains. At the same time, evidentiary burden may then also be implied on the
                    exponent of the practice which also depict that it is not hazardous. For example – national forest
                    regulations may also need specific consideration to get concession for forestry and this also safeguards
                    the impact on biodiversity.
                </p>
                <p>Thus also states that there is a need of strong version of precautionary which may also require definite
                    evidence that the practice will not lead to any cause or any sort of impact prior it is allowed to be
                    proceeded. For instance – under the Revised Management Procedure, development is required under the
                    International Whaling Commission which also depicts the risk of overexploitation. This is also
                    enumerated and can be determined on lower level. Where there are serious irreversible aspects that can
                    produce harm, activities are considered as dangerous; hence it needs to be entirely prohibited in all
                    aspects. Therefore, in various countries, there exists a multiple cessation on driftnet fishing which
                    requires the application of the South Africa Marine Living Resources Act. This also forbids the
                    utilization of risk associated elements that could impact the development of fisheries. Hence,
                    precaution in conservation is also linked with broad conceptual or management approaches. This states
                    that the species- based approaches shows varied global and national which are developed for the purpose
                    of enhancing the value of conservation and protection of natural resources. Therefore, in this dimension
                    the ecosystem approach incorporate the understanding regarding ecosystem which is largely unpredictable
                    and uncertain.

                <h4>QUESTION 3
                </h4>
                <h5>Interpreting the technical requirements and importance of international accounting standards
                </h5>
                <p>International Accounting standards have high level of importance which ensures high level transparency
                    and standardization in the financial statements. Hence, final accounts which are prepared according to
                    IFRS are highly reliable in nature and thereby helps stakeholders in making decisions (Florou, Kosi and
                    Pope, 2017). However, technical knowledge is highly required among the individuals or accounting
                    personnel to deal with the aspects of International Accounting Standards such as IAS 12 and 26 etc. In
                    this, accounting personnel must have ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities. Moreover,
                    assets, revenue received in advance, other liabilities, unrecognized items; consolidated financial
                    statements are the main bases of taxation (Warren, 2016). By taking into consideration all such bases
                    accounting personnel can assess or determine the tax liability. In addition to this, in IAS 12 contains
                    rules regarding the measurement of deferred tax. Along with this, tax rate are also varied from one year
                    to another. In this, accounting personnel is required to update with changing rules and policies.
                    Through this, finance manager and accounting personnel would become able to determine suitable tax
                    liability. In addition to this, IAS 26 serves information about retirement plans which can be
                    distinguished into two types such as defined benefit and contribution plan. Hence, it clearly presents
                    information about the recording, measurement and disclosure of information regarding the retirement
                    benefit plans. Hence, for effective presentation accounting personnel must have knowledge regarding the
                    rules and regulations which are related to it (Bond, Govendir and Wells, 2016). Thus, by considering all
                    such aspects it can be said that technical and conceptual knowledge is highly required for dealing with
                    the standards more effectively and efficiently. Moreover, reporting and measurement aspect of pension
                    plan is highly differing from one standard to another (McPhail, Macdonald and Ferguson, 2016). For
                    instance: UK GAAP has different rules in relation to treatment on pension benefits in against to IAS.
                    Hence, conceptual understanding and knowledge is highly required for dealing with the amount of
                    retirement benefits and deferred tax amount. There are several key issues which are associated with
                    financial reporting enumerated below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reporting needs and requirements are mentioned in the regulations which business entity requires
                        following for ensuring transparency in the final accounts. However, sometimes is not possible for
                        the business organization to comply with all the rules to the large extent.
                    </li>
                    <li>Further, some government authorities have framed and introduced legislation which entail that
                        companies are not obliged to prepare financial statements according to accounting standards.
                        Moreover, sometimes treasurer directives also enforce accounting standard which company has to
                        follow for the preparation of financial statements.
